    "faq": "<div id=\"content\">   <section>     <h2>       I&rsquo;m seeing a lot of acronyms that are unfamiliar. &ldquo;IL,&rdquo; &ldquo;SE,&rdquo;, and       &ldquo;OTF&rdquo; - what&rsquo;s that all about?     </h2>      <p>       Like most communities, we tend to abbreviate commonly-used words or phrases to save time. &ldquo;IL&rdquo;       stand for &ldquo;interlocutor&rdquo; (your conversation partner). &ldquo;SE&rdquo; is short for &ldquo;Street       Epistemology.&rdquo; &ldquo;OTF&rdquo; is short for John W. Loftus&rsquo; &ldquo;Outsider Test for       Faith.&rdquo;     </p>      <p>       Here is a list of commonly-used acronyms:       <br />       <a href=\"https://streetepistemology.com/publications/list_of_common_acronyms_used_in_street_epistemology\">         https://streetepistemology.com/publications/list_of_common_acronyms_used_in_street_epistemology       </a>     </p>      <hr />     <h2>What is the purpose of SE?</h2>      <p>       The general goal of Street Epistemology is to help people to reflect on the reasons and methods that they use       to conclude that their deeply-held beliefs are true.&nbsp;     </p>      <p>       Encouraging someone to reflect on a belief via SE can introduce doubt and is sometimes called &quot;planting a       seed&quot; or &quot;placing a pebble in the shoe&quot; - a positive SE outcome that can lead to the individual       either finding better and more solid reasons for believing what they believe or discarding a belief after       realizing that it has poor foundations. Verbal or nonverbal indications of reflective thinking and hearing the       phrase &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; are good signs. Side benefits of having the conversation can include the       opportunity to model openness and to teach the SE technique.     </p>      <p>       However, it is important to recognize that not all practitioners and conversations are the same, that       different practitioners may have different understandings of what the ultimate aim of street epistemology       should be, and that a practitioner&#39;s goals may shift as a conversation progresses.&nbsp;     </p>      <p>       For additional information, click here:       <br />       <a href=\"https://streetepistemology.com/publications/street_epistemology_the_basics\">         https://streetepistemology.com/publications/street_epistemology_the_basics       </a>     </p>      <hr />     <h2>Do SE conversations require flagging down strangers for interviews on camera?</h2>      <p>       No, not at all. People can get this impression because the &ldquo;strangers on camera&rdquo; interviews are       published and shared (and unrecorded conversations are not), but it&rsquo;s misleading. SE is a tool which can       be used in any conversation in just about any context.     </p>      <hr />     <h2>Is Street Epistemology atheist evangelizing and/or proselytizing?</h2>      <p>       At first glance, it can certainly seem like that is the case. The words &ldquo;street&rdquo; can give the       impression that this is akin to &ldquo;street preaching,&rdquo; and many of most visible examples of SE are       filmed on the street with people in public and often examine God claims.     </p>      <p>       However, when someone is proselytizing, they are usually confident that they have the answers and want to tell       you what you should believe. In contrast, a street epistemologist will ask questions about what you believe in       an effort to understand and examine the epistemology of your belief.&nbsp;     </p>      <p>       A sincere SE-er aims to encourage their conversation partner to explore what they believe, why they believe       it, and how they determined that their belief is true. Further, the SE-er should always try to remind       themselves to be open to their interlocutor&rsquo;s claim and should be willing to increase their confidence       in that claim if it appears that the belief is indeed based on a reliable method.     </p>      <hr />     <h2>My friend believes something that is likely untrue. How can I get them to change their mind?</h2>      <p>       It&rsquo;s great that you want to help your friend hold beliefs that align with reality. And yet it is       important to try and view SE as a tool to explore a person&rsquo;s foundation for their belief--if they are       willing and provide consent! If they are not ready to have this conversation, don&rsquo;t try to force it.     </p>      <p>       Be prepared for the possibility that your friend based their belief on good reasons and a solid method. And if       they didn&rsquo;t, try to make the discovery an exciting project that you can both embark on together.     </p>      <p>       Ultimately, however, your conversation partner will be the one who may decide to lower (or raise) their       confidence in their belief, or perhaps even discard it outright. Your questions may be instrumental in       facilitating honest reflection, but remind yourself that people tend to change their minds when they are ready       to do so; oftentimes, at some cost.     </p>      <p>       These conversations and what they lead to may be painful, and they may trigger hostility in defense of the       belief. If you practice SE with the people who are close to you, bear in mind that it may affect your       relationship with them.     </p>      <hr />     <h2>I disagree with what my interlocutor has claimed. Should I tell them?</h2>      <p>This is an excellent and frequently-asked question in SE circles.</p>      <p>       It is up to the practitioner to decide how much to reveal about your position on the claim being discussed and       when. Some may wish to wait until after the belief has been investigated to avoid causing a person to become       defensive or uneasy. Others feel it is important to disclose one&rsquo;s position beforehand out a matter of       respect and/or to model honesty, even if doing so could make a discussion a bit tougher to navigate.&nbsp;     </p>      <p>       Some SE-ers may offer to disclose their position after the claimant&rsquo;s views have been explored so as not       to sway them one way or the other. If you offer to do this, make sure you follow through and reveal your       views--it might even make for a good opportunity for them to question you using the same approach!     </p>      <p>       Regardless of your decision, it is best to set aside your biases and views on the claim as much as possible       since it is your interlocutor&rsquo;s position that we want to examine.     </p>      <hr />     <h2>Do I have to study formal, academic epistemology to do SE?</h2>      <p>       Formal study is unnecessary since SE is not the application or study of epistemology, but rather a       conversational technique developed to assist laypersons in having productive conversations about       epistemology.&nbsp;     </p>      <p>       That being said, it&#39;s very helpful to understand what epistemology is as well as the philosophical       definitions of and distinctions between knowledge, belief, and confidence. In addition, formal study of       epistemology in an academic setting may enable you to go beyond the basics of SE to dialogue with those who       are themselves studied in epistemology or to develop your own techniques for effective dialogue on the topic.       So it can be beneficial to practicing SE, but it is not a prerequirement.     </p>      <hr />     <h2>Are there reasons to prefer SE methods over other methods of engagement?</h2>      <p>For example:</p>      <ul>       <li>Directly presenting evidence which counters their belief</li>       <li>Ridiculing their beliefs</li>       <li>Showing them the counter-apologetics and refutations of their claims</li>     </ul>      <p>       SE was originally created to avoid common psychological biases which impede cordial discussions and       self-examination when people feel that their deeply-held beliefs are being attacked. Whether SE is the       &ldquo;best&rdquo; way to approach a given conversation will largely depend on your implicit and explicit       goals, as well as the context of the conversation. It is recommended to ask yourself introspective questions       such as:     </p>      <ul>       <li>         What outcomes have I obtained from each approach in past conversations, and are those the outcomes I desire         here?       </li>       <li>         Has my IL already made up their mind on this topic, and are they receptive to evidence which disconfirms         their stance?       </li>       <li>         Is it important that they enjoy the conversation, and leave the door open to future discussions on this         topic?       </li>       <li>         Am I currently in a professional setting, at a family gathering, on a radio call-in show, or have other         special circumstances? Does the setting affect the approach I should use?       </li>     </ul>      <p>       More information:       <br />       <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds\">         https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds       </a>     </p>      <hr />     <h2>Are there times where it could be harmful to practice SE?</h2>      <p>       Depending on your goals, the answer is almost certainly yes. It is broadly accepted that there are contexts in       which SE has potential to do more harm than good.     </p>      <p>       More information:       <br />       <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtmtIBIBfNI\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtmtIBIBfNI</a>     </p>      <hr />     <h2>I&rsquo;d like to learn how to use SE.

I had discovered Street Epistemology after having watched the spectacle that was Anthony Magnabosco\u2019s attempt at teaching SE to Aron Ra, like a ballet instructor trying to teach a wrestler to pirouette. I had done my homework\u2014watched the tutorials, various practitioner\u2019s videos, and even slapped together my own SE toolbox with the aid of a some double-sided tape. All I needed to do now was walk up to an actual person and initiate a conversation about their most personal beliefs. No biggy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinding a location had been my biggest worry since I started entertaining the idea of taking up SE. It seemed to me that my idols in the US had a much better deal than I\u2014in South Africa, or in my town at least, people seem to keep to themselves, only popping into public when they have to. I set out for the Groenkloof Nature Reserve, the closest thing to a well-frequented public park that I knew of in my area, and hoped for the best.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe park was beautiful. The environment seemed perfectly suited to deep reflection, as long as you could ignore the kwaito rhythmically streaming from parked cars where groups of friends were enjoying the outdoors with a traditional South African braai. The camaraderie was inspiring, until you imagined interjecting yourself into their conversations with what until now seemed to be a simple question: \u201CExcuse me, can you spare 5 minutes to talk about a deeply-held belief?\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI chastised myself as I got back into my car. \u201CYou\u2019re chickening out.\u201D I had tried to will myself to approach some of the families at the park, but kept finding excuses not to do so. \u201CNot only do you want to cut into this guy\u2019s family time, but you want him to leave his toddler baking in the sun while he talks to you? You MONSTER.\u201D Defeat was imminent, but I wasn\u2019t ready to give up yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMy mind was racing. This was my first outing into the world of SE, and returning home without even initiating a conversation seemed unbearable. \u201CWhat would Anthony do?\u201D Each option that I considered was almost immediately disqualified by the newfound set of requirements I used to discredit the nature reserve. So, even though I knew that it was late afternoon on a Sunday, and that it was probably wishful thinking that anyone would still be there, I set out for the university campus nearby.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJackpot. I parked close to one of the campus entrances, where students were entering and exiting in dribs and drabs. I took up my clipboard, got out of the car, and started walking up to the first person I saw\u2014and passed them without saying a word. Walking straight up to someone just didn\u2019t seem right, or at least that\u2019s what my stomach that had spontaneously twisted itself into several knots led me to believe. Instead, I took up a spot underneath a jacaranda tree close to the campus entrance, and waited for my first candidate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENthabe* was a bright eyed girl who very cheerfully acquiesced to an interview. I immediately started to relax, which was amazing considering that I imagined my greeting spontaneously collapsing to the gravity I had attributed to this moment. Jesus Christ as the one true god was the topic of discussion. The hours on Youtube seemed to pay off, as our conversation identified god\u2019s guidance as the foundation for her belief, as exemplified by her having the opportunity to enroll to university\u2014a first in her family. Our conversation was pleasant. At various times she would pause at my questions, and she had no qualms with responding with an \u201CI don\u2019t know.\u201D After asking her what would change her mind, and she coming to the realization that even when hardship befell her she would consider it a reason to enforce the belief, I was happy to thank her for her time and send her on her way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMy next interlocutor, TK, was a snappily-dressed first year student who put his belief in god at 80% on the confidence scale, with how he was raised being his main reason for believing. After an interesting conversation where he explained that he would be enticed by a religion that was closer to his values, but that he would still find it difficult to abandon the religion of his parents for reasons unknown, we parted with some homework to try and discern why he would be hesitant.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENext up was Jim, with a belief in the importance of kindness. He was kind enough to share that he had reached the lowest point in his life the prior year. This made him realize the importance of empathy and kindness to others, since you do not know what they might be going through. Although this was a very interesting conversation, it was tough, since this was a belief that I shared with him. His belief seemed to be well-founded. He scoffed slightly at the question: \u201CCan kindness be a bad thing?\u201D but identified circumstances where kindness can be taken advantage of. At the end of the conversation, he stated that even though he still believes in its importance, he acknowledges that it should be applied in context to any given situation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next interlocutor, Emily, was extremely hesitant to speak to me when I mentioned the topic of the interview. I saw this as an opportunity, and suggested that we could discuss the statement: \u201CIt is bad to discuss your beliefs.\u201D She hesitantly decided that she would rather discuss her belief in god. From the outset, it seemed to me as if Emily approached the conversation as a situation where she had to defend her faith. Her epistemology was confusing, but after some discussion we eventually agreed upon stating it as: \u201CTrust in god that provides you with a conviction whereby you know that the Bible is true.\u201D I struggled to point out the circular reasoning of this statement, and was frustrated to discover how many other logical fallacies were layered on top of it. After she found reason after reason to dismiss any conclusion apart from the Christian god using the same mechanism, I considered Emily to be doxastically closed. She was relieved when I finally released her from her trial of faith, and we parted ways amicably.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally there was Sfiso, an engineering student who unceremoniously pegged his confidence in the Bible and Christianity at 20%. I was immediately intrigued by his low confidence and instead of asking him why he was still at 20%, I inquired as to his reason for the low confidence. He expressed his theory that the Christian religion might be a mechanism of suppression forced on Africans by colonialists. He also expressed that due to the Bible originating in the Middle East and its seeming indifference to Africa, he struggled to reconcile some of its contents with reality.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI really appreciated Sfiso\u2019s honesty, open-mindedness and consideration towards his beliefs. He had mentioned earlier in the conversation that the natural world seemed to him to be evidence of some god. He said that he still read the Bible, attended Church and prayed to god to reveal his true nature to him, which prompted me to present him with a thought experiment. What if, when he was done with his studies, his thirst for truth led him around the world, investigating the claims of each religion? And what if, after his journey, he came to discover that none of the world\u2019s religions correlated to reality to such a degree that it would satisfy him? His answer surprised me. \u201CI would go back to my culture, to my Zulu roots. I would pray to my forefathers, and sacrifice goats to them.\u201D I asked him why he would do so. \u201CBecause, if none of these religions gave me a culture, a place to belong, I would have to go back to find a place to belong.\u201D The sentiment was touching and heartbreaking at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis concluded our talk, and Sfiso jumped at the opportunity to ask me about my beliefs. I explained that I do not believe in any god, and that I couldn\u2019t see a reason to do so until I was provided with evidence\u2014an approach which he found interesting. I took the opportunity to suggest Bart Ehrman\u2019s videos to him, explaining that it provides useful insights into the origins of the New Testament. He accepted the suggestion enthusiastically, writing \u201CBART EHRMAN\u201D on his arm for lack of a piece of paper (Note to self: print some damn cards!). He then stated that he would also like to conduct these interviews, leaving me no other choice but to give him my number and inviting him to get into contact with me if he was interested in more resources or further discussion. My number too was enthusiastically scribbled onto his arm, and we parted with both of us smiling ear-to-ear.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\u2019t have hoped for a better outcome. The experience left me feeling fulfilled and eager for more. Driving home, I had to stop myself from pulling over and starting up more conversations, satisfied to end on the high note that was my talk with Sfiso. I was hesitant to approach SE in South Africa. I didn\u2019t know how South Africans would react to questions that could so easily be perceived as intrusive. I am pleased to report that this was not the case at all. Even when approaching potential interlocutors, I had a success rate of 1 in 2 at initiating a conversation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo concludes the diary of my first steps in Street Epistemology. I hope to have many more adventures exploring beliefs, with the sincere hope that no goats are harmed in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E*Not their actual names.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBen is a software developer and SE enthusiast from South Africa who hopes that the promotion of critical thinking can save the world.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E"

The non-confrontational, methodical, friendly approach, I thought, would allow me to have interesting and effective conversations with anyone, about anything. I was correct.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst using the method online in text chats, and later organically in conversations (and with a few Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses!), I began desiring \u201Creal\u201D SE interviews. Partially inspired by the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/So4O34LyF_U\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EFree Intelligent Conversation\u003C/a\u003E movement, I decided to set up regularly at my local coffee shop. As of this writing, I\u2019ve done more than 20 interviews on topics such as God, Karma, nurture vs. nature, the existence of alien life, prayer, immigration, male circumcision and more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe purpose of this blog post is to teach the reader how to do SE successfully in a coffee shop. For many people, coffee shops are close-by and accessible year-round. Below, I\u2019ve outlined what I\u2019ve learned, which I hope will inspire many others to do coffee shop SE.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMy preferred location is a coffee shop, in this case a Starbucks, but a casual restaurant (in the United States think Panera Bread) also works well. Both of these establishments are amenable to people camping out for hours on end while working. It is good form to also be a paying patron.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EThe Essentials\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe bare minimum for SE is: a sign, a notepad, a pen, and a friendly disposition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowing is a complete list of what I bring. Keep in mind, I\u2019m camping at these locations primarily to work, doing SE only as a hobby to break up the day. I bring a backpack, laptop, phone charger, light jacket (these places often crank up the A/C), \u003Ca href=\u0022https://streetepistemology.com/publications/addressing_it_s_true_for_me_relativism_in_street_epistemology\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003ETic Tacs\u003C/a\u003E, gum, and business cards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI try to wear a colorful shirt to stand out and in general look professional and approachable. Not to be captain obvious, but don\u2019t wear a ball cap with a hoodie tightly drawn around your face and sunglasses. Also, don\u2019t try too hard; people will think you are trying to sell them something.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EThe Method\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI scout out a 2-person table where my sign will be visible to people entering and leaving. The high-top tables at Starbucks don\u2019t work well, as people often sit across from you and wouldn\u2019t give a prospective conversation partner a place to sit. Also, I don\u2019t hog the large round tables.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI keep my radar on. If I spot someone reading my sign, I\u2019ll smile, wave, and point to the sign. They will usually come over out of curiosity. Even a 30 second exchange when the person doesn\u2019t have time for an SE interview might brighten someone\u2019s day. \u201CThat\u2019s really cool what you are doing\u201D, \u201CMaybe next time\u201D, or \u201CWe could use more intelligent conversation\u201D are just some of the comments I frequently get from would-be interlocutors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBringing the backpack helps me keep a clean, clutter free table. My table has the sign and my laptop, that\u2019s all. I\u2019ll pull my notepad out when someone sits down and close the laptop. Closing the laptop signals to your IL you aren\u2019t half-working or distracted and are now focused entirely on the interview.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EDetails \u0026amp; FAQs\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA printed \u003Ca href=\u0022https://freeic.org/shop/sign\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Esign\u003C/a\u003E is a must\u003C/strong\u003E. I first experimented with a hand-written sign. Last year, I happened to be in a city where I had to work at a coffee shop for a week nearly 6 hours per day. I got no interviews with the hand written sign. Zero. None. What are my results with the printed sign? I get a few interviews each time I go out!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDo you need permission?\u003C/strong\u003E I have not asked staff permission, since I\u2019m passively getting people to sit down with me, but if it puts your mind at ease, mention it to the staff first. Reassure them that you are not selling anything and are only passively putting out a sign and won\u2019t bug people. So, don\u2019t bug people; let them come to you. I\u2019m now somewhat known by the staff at my regular location, and some of the staff have even done interviews.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are the drawbacks?\u003C/strong\u003E The major downside to coffee shop SE is it\u2019s a terrible location to record video or audio. If this isn\u2019t your goal, as it isn\u2019t mine (you won\u2019t find me on YouTube, sorry), it\u2019s a moot point. Also, it can take a while to get an IL, if you get one at all. I work while waiting for a conversation partner, so think about productive things you can do in the down time, such as reading \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.amazon.com/Manual-Creating-Atheists-Peter-Boghossian/dp/1939578094\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EAMFCA\u003C/a\u003E. In short, this isn\u2019t the steady stream of interlocutors you see Anthony Magnabosco or others getting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow do I initiate interviews?\u003C/strong\u003E Here\u2019s my lead in: \u201CHi, I\u2019m Adam. I work from home, but like to work here a day a week to break up the routine. I came up with this hobby to have intelligent conversations and exercise critical thinking. What I do is interview people for 5 minutes, or more if you want, on a belief they hold to be true. What we do together is examine your reasons you believe it is true and how you determined it actually is true. It\u2019s fun!\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EConclusion\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe doing Street Epistemology in a coffee shop is a great idea for those interested in trying the method, but who don\u2019t desire or have time to produce content. Coffee shop SE offers a low barrier to entry insofar as it only requires a sign. You don\u2019t need a table, microphones, GoPros, editing software, etc. If you are one of the many people already spending significant amounts of times in coffee shops and casual restaurants, why not mix in a little SE with your Venti? You\u2019ll be glad you did.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E"

Due to the impromptu nature of this encounter, I was unable to record it. I wanted to share it due to the quality of the experience, with Anthony\u0027s encouragement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, a bit of backstory: I was sitting at Subway\u2122 with my girlfriend to support and protect our friend who works there. She had just had a sandwich thrown at her by an irate customer, and was afraid he would come back. To pass the time, I brought in \u0027A Manual for Creating Atheists\u0027, which I am in the middle of reading for the first time. Our co-worker struck up a conversation with a new customer, \u0027Sammy\u0027. Sammy is a pretty outgoing and chill guy. He empathized with her, and we all agreed that the irate sandwich-throwing customer was a huge jerk.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs he turned to leave, he asked me what I was reading.\u0026nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\nMe: \u0022Don\u0027t let the title throw you off, it\u0027s called \u0027A Manual for Creating Atheists\u0027. It\u0027s more about how to have civil and productive conversations regarding faith.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nSammy: \u0022But it\u0027s written from the atheist perspective?\u0022\u0026nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\nMe: \u0022Yes, but the techniques can be utilized by anyone. It does have some built-in assumptions, such as that there is an objective reality that we can be right or wrong about.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESammy then talked about his perspective: that of an evangelical Christian. It was at this moment that I knew I was about to SE. I think my girlfriend sensed it, too; she got up to go talk to our friend at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI asked him why he believes in God. He told me about how before he became a Christian, he just lived for himself, and was into drugs and such to find his fulfillment. He emphasized that he is a more emotional person, and remarked that I seem to be a much more logical person (this came up a few times throughout the conversation). I made sure to clarify his position, and had him assign himself a level of certainty. He assigned himself a 99%.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI then introduced the Outsider Test for Faith, using the example of a Hindu woman who has a similar story. His eyes went wide, and he said \u0022That\u0027s a very good question!\u0022, and seemed to genuinely mean it. I clarified with him that he does think she is incorrect, that they can\u0027t both be right. He confirmed this, and I encouraged him by agreeing that I also think she is incorrect. I took this opportunity to gently press him one more time, asking how we could figure out which one of them is correct, since they are both using the same methods. He said \u0022Man, I need to think about that for a minute.\u0022 I tell him to take his time; I planned to be there until the store closed.He proceeded to pause for literally about 20 glorious seconds, thinking of an answer. \u0022I don\u0027t know. How would you try to figure it out?\u0022 He finally asked.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince he has been such a great interlocutor, I decided to answer his question. \u0022You mentioned how you and I both have different personalities; you\u0027re a more emotional person, and I am more analytical. But when it comes down to it, I want *reliable* ways of coming to conclusions; methods that consistently yield results that are aligned with reality. If you have an emotional method that is *reliable*, I am happy to use it.\u0022 I then talked to him about the concept of falsification, and re-phrased the OTF by asking him how could we figure out who is *incorrect*. Another fantastic pause, and \u0022I don\u0027t know\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI marked this as the formal end of the conversation, but we continued talking. We clarified the definitions of \u0022Atheist/Theist/Agnostic\u0022 by graphing \u0022Atheist and Theist\u0022 along the vertical axis, and \u0022Gnostic/Agnostic\u0022 along the horizontal axis, and I placed myself in the \u0022Agnostic Atheist\u0022 block. He put himself in the \u0022Gnostic Theist\u0022 block, saying that he is absolutely certain that God exists; that he is 100% certain. It sounded like his distinction between 99% and 100% certainty was semantics.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, Sammy showed that he is a natural Street Epistemologist, and asked me \u0022What would change your mind? What would shift you to the theist side?\u0022\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI first complimented him on the question, telling him he should really look into SE. Then I said that I will happily answer his question by first posing a thought experiment to explain my answer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI asked him whether he would believe me if I told him I owned a cat, and showed him a picture of me with my cat. He said \u0022Yes, absolutely.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI asked if he would believe me if I told him I owned a tiger, and showed him a picture of me with a tiger. He said \u0022Not really.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI then asked if he would believe me if I told him there was a dragon in my garage, and then showed him a picture of me with a live dragon. He said \u0022Not at all.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI then asked \u0022Would you consider God to be more spectacular of a claim than a dragon?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe grinned, seeing where I was going with this. \u0022Yeah, for the sake of the example.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI said \u0022I would need something pretty darn spectacular. If all the stars in the sky re-aligned themselves into the words \u0027This is God, I exist, and I am also the Christian God specifically\u0027, and everyone else in the world also saw it, then that would be pretty compelling, maybe even enough to shift me to the theist side. Of course, the idea that I live in the Matrix is also a possibility no more spectacular than God, so I would still have my doubts.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe had a bit more banter at this point which I don\u0027t recall, but at some point I threw one last question at him, and asked \u0022How would the world look any different if you were wrong about God?\u0022 Another \u0022I don\u0027t know.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe conversation turned to my Ravenclaw scarf, and his enjoyment of the Harry Potter series. I almost recommended that he read the \u0022Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality\u0022 fanfic, but I missed that opportunity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe closed on a very positive note. He called this \u0022No joke, the best conversation I have ever had.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a parting thought, he asked me to look up a particular personality quiz - he acknowledged that most of them are bunk, but he likes this one. I thanked him for the recommendation, and gave him a parting thought as well: I asked him to dwell on what reliable methods we could use to determine which God is the correct one. He agreed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EMistakes\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile I consider this to have been an unmitigated success, as he experienced several points of aporia and had such a positive view of the conversation, there are a couple things I forgot to do that I wish I had done. If and when I have a follow-up conversation, I\u0027ll be sure to remedy all three things:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, I forgot to get his contact info. I chalk this up to being brand new to this. Thankfully, he is a regular at that Subway\u2122, so my girlfriend and her friend (who both work there) can get his contact info for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I forgot to explicitly ask (although I implied it heavily) \u0022If \u0027life changing experience\u0027 can be used to come to various conflicting beliefs, what does that say about its reliability?\u0022\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThird, I also forgot to ask \u0022If there\u0027s no way to know which one of you is correct/incorrect, is absolute certainty really the best place to be on this belief?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EThings I did right\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI managed to elicit doxastic openness (Sammy\u2019s willingness to reflect) despite having all my atheistic cards on the table from the get-go. I did this by acting as genial as possible, to help lower any visceral defenses that might be put up. I\u2019m sure Sammy\u2019s natural open-mindedness played a large part in that as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI reveled in the pauses. Usually, pauses in conversation beg to be filled. Since I am new to SE, I am not sure if this was an anomaly or not, but I loved them. Every passing moment of Sammy\u2019s silent reflection was euphoric.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EConclusion\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESE can be used anywhere! Not only is it a great method for helping people question their faith, it also results in amazing conversations. Stay rational! And remember: \u201CThe map is not the territory.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Chr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EAuthor Bio\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, my name is Alex.

This provides me with an interesting situation in that I feel compelled to keep my atheism closeted, but at the same time there is a great need in my community for SE and also lots of great opportunities that I\u2019ve been able to capitalize upon.\u003C/em\u003E\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been to several live talks given by Anthony Magnabosco on the subject of Street Epistemology (SE). He\u0027s as calm and gentle in real life as he is on his videos and his talks are thorough and patient as you might expect if you\u0027ve ever seen his YouTube channel. At the end of his talks he usually opens the floor to some Q\u0026amp;A and a common audience reaction has been a suggestion that SE is just \u0022us doing to them what they\u0027ve always done to us.\u0022 I find this idea rather baffling, but it is common enough that I wanted to address it here.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nLike many of you, I\u0027ve had to deal with people knocking on my door asking if I\u0027ve found Jesus. I\u0027ve seen them standing on street corners screaming through megaphones. I\u0027ve seen news reports of them protesting funerals. I\u0027ve had to be at public events and stop what I am doing as I am forced to listen to them broadcast their prayers over the loudspeakers. For so long I\u0027ve been so tired of being proselytized that I sometimes feel like screaming \u201CI don\u0027t want your god! Pray all you want, but stop trying to get me to live under the rules of YOUR imaginary friend!!\u201D \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should be obvious that SE is decidedly different from religious proselytizing for a number of reasons. Clearly I am not telling someone what to believe, but rather  just asking questions about how they came to the beliefs they currently hold and helping them establish the reliability of the methods they use. I\u0027m finding truth, not \u0022sharing\u0022 what I already believe to be the truth. SE is about asking rather than telling. It is about listening rather than talking. And yet, despite the obvious differences I sometimes still don\u2019t feel comfortable initiating SE conversations with others.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOne misconception I\u0027ve often heard about SE is that one has to go out and interview strangers on the street in the way so many SE YouTube videos are done. I mean, the term \u0022Street Epistemology\u0022 literally has \u0022Street\u0022 in the name. Likewise, the more visible signs of Street Epistemology like the conversations with strangers video recorded and posted to YouTube might indicate that type of interaction as the norm.  However, the most visible examples of interactions between believers and non-believers might not be the most common nor the most effective.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI see real value in engaging random strangers in short conversations about their deeply held beliefs. And I see the value when those interactions are recorded and analyzed for effectiveness and this value is multiplied every time someone else watches the videos and is able to learn something from them. I am grateful for the videos created and posted by Street Epistemology pioneers like Anthony Magnabosco, Socrates Jones, and others. However, this is not the only way to conduct an SE conversation, and it might not even be the best way, particularly for your temperament and conversation style. So, if you\u0027ve seen SE videos and thought \u0022There is no way I\u0027m going to do that\u0022, well, welcome to my club! \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen doing Street Epistemology, I converse with others about the methods they used to come to their beliefs. It doesn\u2019t matter who initiates the conversation. If you are comfortable starting the conversation, by all means, go ahead. But you can also conduct SE when believers initiate the conversation. I can tell you that I\u0027ve been doing SE since shortly after Peter Boghossian released his book \u003Cem\u003EA Manual for Creating Atheists\u003C/em\u003E and I have never initiated a SE conversation. Every talk I\u2019ve had was initiated by the other party. Oh, they might not have expected to have me ask questions about what they said, but it was THEY who opened the conversation. I\u2019ve never knocked on a door or approached a random stranger to talk about anything SE related. \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere I live in the Bible Belt of the deep south, I never have to wait more than a week or two before someone says something to me that is either blatant proselytizing or an attempt to reconfirm that they are surrounded by like-minded people. This might be a request to pray, it could be statement that praises their god for something as simple as a sunset or as personal as their successful bout with cancer. They might ask what church I go to. They might ask if my child is enrolled in church camp or Vacation Bible School. It could even be about something unrelated to religion: a family member about getting her son Ionic Foot Detox Therapy twice a week, or an email about wanting to share a Groupon for an acupuncture session. When these conversations are started, I can seamlessly, graciously, and politely begin the SE process on THEIR terms.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd of course, you can always decide later to strap on a video camera and take to the parks to engage the faithful. But you shouldn\u0027t ever feel pressure to do so. It\u2019s just as effective to do Street Epistemology only when the opportunity arises in the course of your daily life.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\n\t\t\u003C/p\u003E"

It has bright lights, billboards, tourists, buskers, and of course, street preachers. In true Toronto fashion, it\u0027s a diverse group: the young guy with the megaphone who yells that you\u0027re going to burn in Hell is across the street from the old guy who mutters \u0022Believe!\u0022 as he thrusts a crumpled tract in your direction. \u0026nbsp;A few metres away some Muslim folks offer free copies of the Qur\u0027an, while just a bit farther still are the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, quietly waiting for people to approach them and take a copy of The Watchtower. On some days you\u0027ll be asked to sign a petition to stop the persecution of Falun Dafa practitioners in China, and if you\u0027re really lucky you might have someone posing as a Buddhist monk ask you for money.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI have been passing by this spectacle for years, but since I have never really wanted what these people were selling, I have averted my gaze and steered clear. It was only recently, after discovering Street Epistemology, that I first considered approaching one of these people and striking up a conversation. Ironically, though, the more I learned about SE, the less confident I felt. I had watched countless example videos, read \u201CA Manual For Creating Atheists\u201D and \u201CThe Outsider Test for Faith,\u201D and had many conversations with strangers online, friends, and family members. I still felt unprepared to dive into a chat with these heavyweights. Sometimes I was in a rush, or not in the right headspace, but most of the time I just plain chickened out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil last week.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI found myself at Yonge \u0026amp; Dundas on a beautiful summer night with nothing but time on my hands as I waited to meet my girlfriend. This was it. I stood on the corner for a bit, taking in the scene that I described above. There was a group of 3-4 Christians chatting with each other and lazily handing out their material, so I strolled over, fully prepared to just keep walking if they didn\u0027t approach me. Just when I thought I would have to try again some other time, a tall young man named Dave handed me a Chick Tract (it was called \u201CThe Bull,\u201D in case you want to check it out). The conversation went something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMe: Ah, thanks man. Can you tell me about this thing you\u0027re handing out?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDave: This is called a tract. It\u0027s about\u003Cem\u003E [gives synopsis of The Bull\u003C/em\u003E], so basically we\u0027re all sinners and we can only be saved through Jesus Christ.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMe: Ok, cool, I\u0027ll check it out. Do you mind if I ask you some questions about that though?\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDave: Sure, that\u0027s why we\u0027re out here!\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMe: Great, thanks. You said we were all sinners, and I guess I wanted to ask about that. Is everyone a sinner, including that little girl?\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDave: Yes, everyone. Jesus said \u003Cem\u003E[some Bible verse read from his phone]\u003C/em\u003E, so the nature of man is to sin, and someone has to pay for that sin, which is where Jesus comes in. It also says\u003Cem\u003E [another Bible verse],\u003C/em\u003E so since it\u0027s our nature to sin, that girl will sin eventually, just like all of us. That\u0027s why we need Jesus.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMe: Ah, ok. I guess I can understand that idea. It looks like you place a lot of importance in what the Bible says, is that right?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDave: Of course! The Bible is the ultimate source of truth. You see, \u003Cem\u003E[long rant about how evolution is \u201Cjust a theory,\u201D immorality is everywhere, God\u0027s law, etc]\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMe: Wow, you threw a lot at me there! I want to go back to the first thing you said: the Bible is the ultimate source of truth, right?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDave: Yeah, it\u0027s true.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMe: Ok. I\u0027m not saying I can do this, but if it could be shown that the Bible wasn\u0027t reliable, that it got something wrong, what effect would that have on your belief in god?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDave: \u003Cem\u003E[Looks at me, looks up, looks at his phone, looks back at me.]\u003C/em\u003E Uh, I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve never thought about that before... but... the Bible is true, so...\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMe: If I can ask another question\u2014that gentleman over there is handing out copies of the Qur\u0027an. If we assume he says that the Qur\u0027an is the ultimate source of truth, how could we determine which one of you is right?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDave: Uh, well I don\u0027t know much about the Qur\u0027an...\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMe: Neither do I, but do you think there\u0027s a way we can find out which of the two books are reliable?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDave: Um... I mean, I think you should talk to Wendy. She knows a lot more about this than me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMe: Well, I\u0027m happy to talk to Wendy, but I\u2014\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore I could explain that I wanted to know what he thought, Dave cut me off by walking over to his friends. He said something to one of the women, presumably Wendy, and she followed him back to where I was standing. She asked, \u201CSo you have some questions about the Qur\u0027an?\u201D I quickly clarified what I had asked.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWendy was a much more seasoned apologist than Dave, and she seemed not only to have Biblical knowledge, but knowledge of the Qur\u0027an as well. She asked, \u201CWhy would you want to follow that book? Did you know there are 99 different versions of it?\u201D And then went on for a bit about all of the bad things about the Qur\u0027an, specifically how Muhammad\u0027s wife Aisha was very young and how he brutally destroyed his enemies while keeping the girls as spoils of war.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMe: Wow, I really appreciate your knowledge on this. So just to be clear, and please correct me if I\u0027m wrong, the Qur\u0027an isn\u0027t worth following because there are many versions and because it is full of violence?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWendy: That\u0027s correct.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThose of you familiar with the Bible know where I went with that, but she dismissed my question with the predictable \u201Cbut that\u0027s the Old Testament.\u201D That didn\u0027t stop her from talking about Adam, Job, and Noah, but I let it slide in an effort to avoid apologetics.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe chatted a bit more until I came back to the same question I had asked originally: how can we know if the Bible is true? At this point it was Wendy\u0027s turn to tap out. \u201CI think you need to speak to my husband Mark,\u201D she said, and went to get him. He came over, said hello, and spoke for a while about Satan, about the Qur\u0027an being a false teaching, and then about how personal experiences following an accident had lead him to Christ. It was a lot of information, and I was running out of time, but we were about to get to what I really wanted to discuss.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMe: Thanks for sharing that. It sounds like some amazing things have happened in your life, and I\u0027m glad you\u0027re doing better now. I guess my question is similar to what I asked Dave, which is how we can be sure that the god of the Bible is the one who helped you through that time?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMark: Ah, well, you have to have faith!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMe: You use faith to know that god was helping you?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWendy: We all use faith every day. If I gave you a chair to sit on, you would have faith that it would hold you up, right? You would sit on it without hesitation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMe: I would trust it, partly because I\u2019ve sat on many chairs before, partly because it seems like I can trust you not to give me a broken chair to sit on. Trust might not be the same as faith. But if, like you say, we all use faith, and the Muslim over there uses faith the same way you do, how do I know who\u0027s right?

I thanked them for their time and tried to excuse myself, but Wendy asked if they could pray for me. I said sure, and she grabbed me by the hand, with Dave grabbing the other. Mark rounded out the circle. \u201COh, you mean right now?\u201D Yes, she did. They lowered their heads while Wendy prayed that Brian would let The Lord into his heart, and ended with, \u201CI\u0027ll ask you Jesus, will you forgive Brian if he opens his heart to you?

I could have asked more open-ended questions, asked where they were on the \u201Cbelief scale,\u201D been more comfortable with politely interrupting when they got off on a tangent. I also know that letting my interlocutor tag out of the talk when they became uncomfortable was not ideal, since they were able to avoid the true introspection I was aiming for.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the same time, I\u0027m considering it a win for a few reasons. First, I kept myself on track, and I asked questions even when I wanted to state facts (about evolution, Noah\u0027s flood, or violence in the Bible). After long strings of Bible verses and apologetics, I was able to say things like, \u0022I appreciate your knowledge of those topics, but you said a lot there and I\u0027d really like to get back to the first thing you said.\u0022 Second, I got the responses \u0022I don\u0027t know\u0022 and \u0022I\u0027ve never thought of that before\u0022 a few times, mostly from Dave. He was very quiet as I spoke with his more experienced partners, but treating him as an audience was helpful to me, and I hope that he left with some things to think about. Third, we had a very cordial chat, and we parted ways with smiles and handshakes. I\u0027m certainly not ready to call myself an expert Street Epistemologist, but I achieved something I was nervous about trying, and I know what I need to do to get better.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll leave you with one more moment from the talk.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the four of us were standing there chatting, a man came over with his crumpled coffee cup asking for change. Wendy and Mark completely ignored him, but Dave was kind enough to put a copy of \u201CThe Bull\u201D in his cup. I wanted to ask if that\u0027s what Jesus would have done, but I kept my mouth shut in the interest of maintaining rapport...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E"

I actually like the idea of recognizing that there are some things that we could do without; in fact, there are some things that actually impede our ability to be our best. This year for Lent I\u2019m giving up certainty. When I say \u201Ccertainty,\u201D I mean \u201Cabsolutely no doubt / there\u2019s-no-way-I-could-be-mistaken\u201D kind of certainty. Street Epistemology is my tool of choice to help me steer clear of such certainty.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe basic motivation for Street Epistemology is to assess one\u2019s level of certainty in a claim and then scrutinize the method(s) used to arrive at that confidence. While the claims often tend toward the supernatural, that\u2019s not always the case. For example, in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA4Vkn3iJi0\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ea recent video entitled \u201CI\u2019m My Mom\u2019s Daughter,\u201D\u003C/a\u003E\u0026nbsp;Anthony Magnabosco has a conversation with two young women. The first woman (Hafsa) claims, with 100% confidence, that the woman she calls \u201CMom\u201D is indeed her biological mother.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf one were to claim 100% confidence in anything, this belief would appear to merit such certainty -- our parentage is such a foundational belief that we have probably never even thought to question it. In my mind, this is where Street Epistemology shines brightest -- when it causes one to reconsider those important beliefs that are taken for granted, those that would otherwise not seem worth questioning.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStreet Epistemology rarely causes someone to abandon a strongly-held belief on the spot (going from 100% to 0%). What it attempts to do is to drill down to the method(s) being used to substantiate a claim and then make sure that the confidence in the claim accurately tracks with the reliability of the method(s).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYet we live in a culture, and perhaps are burdened with built-in brain algorithms, in which black/white, binary thinking appears to be the norm. Street Epistemology, in the interest of knowing as many true things as possible and as few false things as possible, advocates for a reconsideration of such absolute positions.

There is a reason that our politics have become polarized and so many have retreated to (and find comfort/community in) the echo-chambers of certainty found in social media. How do you tactfully and respectfully jog someone who is comfortable with certainty (even if the certainty appears to be inadequately founded) to take a less comfortable position? While SE practitioners tend to ask questions and keep the focus on the interlocutor, there may be a point in the conversation when it is appropriate to share examples (the more personal, the better) that clearly demonstrate the benefits of relinquishing certainty.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile I don\u2019t often practice one-on-one, face-to-face SE with strangers, my method of showing the upside of uncertainty comes in the form of teaching critical thinking skills to my students. For example, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNhb-OBLV18\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Eone of my lectures (\u201CI Can\u2019t Believe I Believed That: Facts \u0026amp; Fallacies in Physics \u0026amp; Astronomy\u201D)\u003C/a\u003E features several examples from my own teaching career in which my own certainty led me to teach scientific concepts incompletely and/or incorrectly. That I was \u201Ccertain\u201D that I was right in what I was teaching prevented me from being the best teacher I could be. I wasn\u2019t deliberately teaching my students things I knew to be wrong, but rather I was teaching them what, at the time, I thought to be \u201Cright,\u201D having never attempted to match my level of confidence in my correctness with the methods I had used to arrive at that confidence. In fact, had I not been challenged, I would never have examined those methods or beliefs in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis goes to show that even someone trained in science and employed as a teacher can fall prey to the siren song of certainty. It is my hope that the critical thinking lectures I deliver to my students teach them that being open to uncertainty, while sometimes uncomfortable, is a path more likely to bend toward truth.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the interest of acknowledging my own biases, I admit a comfort level with uncertainty. Before my current teaching job, I worked for a decade as a professional meteorologist \u2013 six years as a TV weatherman. When was the last time you saw 100% chance of rain/snow show up on a 7-day forecast? How long would a meteorologist remain employed with an \u201Cabsolutely no doubt / there\u2019s-no-way-I-could-be-mistaken\u201D level of certainty? My job had probability built into it and my viewers, explicitly or implicitly, understood that -- just as I understood that probability was inherent in the computer models from which I was developing my forecast. Perhaps this is why I find SE, and its emphasis on probability and percentages, so appealing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EContrast that with my current situation. I live and teach in the Bible Belt South. In a few short weeks when Lent draws to a close, \u201CHe is Risen\u201D will be emblazoned on every church\u2019s sign and trumpeted from every pulpit. For many people who live in my community, this is a foundational truth \u2013 they are as 100% as Hafsa was about the identity of her biological mother.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the risk of a \u201Cspoiler\u201D (you really should watch the video in its entirety), Hafsa moved from her 100% position by the end of the SE conversation. She didn\u2019t abandon the belief entirely, but the SE conversation helped to more accurately match her level of confidence to the reliability of her methods. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if, driving around my town on Easter Sunday morning, I saw a \u201C60% chance that He is Risen\u201D on a church sign?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo my plan is to give up certainty, and not just for Lent. Every day should be an opportunity to scrutinize something that I would never have had reason to previously question. Practicing SE can help you identify your own biases, assess the reliability of the methods you use to arrive at beliefs, and give you a more accurate map of reality.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMortgage Hill Musings makes a living teaching science concepts. When he doesn\u2019t have an answer or a sufficient explanation, he is happy to admit his ignorance.

I sometimes beat myself up if, after the interview, I think of something wittier I could have said. The French have a term for this phenomenon which we do not: \u201CL\u0027esprit de l\u0027escalier,\u201D or \u201CStairwell wit\u201D\u2013to think of a reply too late. What I\u2019m learning through attempting dozens of interviews with a cornucopia of believers is that I should stop beating myself up after bad chats. As long as I am modelling uncertainty, my ability to engender doubt and my ability to help my interlocutor (IL) arrive at more reliable ways of knowing things may be more about what they value than the quality of the Street Epistemology I deliver.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELet\u2019s be honest: when an intervention goes badly, it\u2019s not always on you. A variety of alternative, nearly impossible-to-determine explanations might exist to explain why your IL wouldn\u0027t answer questions directly or refused to budge on their stated confidence level after determining their reasons were unreliable. I\u2019m here to tell you: Stop taking it ALL personally. It\u2019s not always about you. Just do your job!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EImparting doubt on the effectiveness of beating myself up\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps like many of you do, I wish lots of conversations had gone differently. Sure, after looking at some of my earliest recorded interventions, many clearly could have had more productive outcomes through a more practiced form of SE, but could all of my unproductive chats? Even if I had years of SE training, how could I truly know all of my least productive interventions could have had a better outcome, for instance, successfully imparting doubt on a believer who believed something I see as irrational? Just because some people are easily dissuaded, does that mean all people will be easily dissuaded?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI like to look back at my old \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.periscope.tv/idansimpson\u0022\u003EPeriscope interviews\u003C/a\u003E of believers to see the progression of my ability to elicit doubt. Often, I\u2019ll catch myself face-palming as I watch my early mistakes, many of which seem to lead to less-than-fruitful results. Though, while I notice there\u2019s always room for improvement, the truth may be that there is no amount of training that could have saved some of my least productive chats with believers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EAn IL\u2019s revealing statement\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a recent intervention on Periscope, my IL was 60% certain her belief in Existential Nihilism was a true belief. In the chat I had to backtrack several times just to wrap my head around the belief and the thought process surrounding it. Each time I became lost I simply recapped the conversation we had had up to that point. By the end of my chat, which I didn\u2019t think was particularly effective, she was 45% certain Existential Nihilism was a true belief. A net 15% increase in doubt.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEventually, when I asked why her confidence shifted, the IL replied, \u201CBecause you told me my own things I said. (sic) And it made me think and hearing it sounded (sic) Ridiculous to me\u201D.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWow. What a revealing statement. Just hearing her beliefs come out of my mouth (perhaps a few times) made her confidence drop. That which most specifically led to successfully imparting doubt was my own uncertainty in the intervention which, several times, forced me to me summarize the chat up to that point. It is also possible the sincerity of my uncertainty encouraged the same in her as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStop and think about it: as long as we do a decent job as Street Epistemologists (arguably not very difficult), our ability to successfully impart doubt may be ALL about the IL\u2019s willingness to be open to honest investigation and their willingness to amend their beliefs when viewed through the lens of critical thinking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003ESo, let\u2019s say it\u2019s more about the IL than the SE-er; do we stop trying to improve? Why try at all?\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs it is for any dialectical technique used for engaging folks with a particular goal, there will always be room to improve. Continue reviewing your chats (or start now, if you don\u2019t already) with fresh eyes, considering what else you could have done (what alternatives exist?).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you haven\u0027t already started engaging in these types of chats, remember that you\u2019re exactly as good at SE as you need to be right now to have talks with others about the reasons they believe. This alone is a needed public service. Yes, by doing SE more often, with a variety of people, your skills and the quality of interventions will grow naturally and you can begin to elicit doubt more effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me, realizing there\u2019s always room to improve is reason enough to not take it all personally when an intervention goes wrong. If, perhaps, no amount of practice could help me reach Street Epistemology perfection, then in that sense I am already perfect, right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EThe spectrum of open-mindedness\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter attempting several interventions, you\u2019ll get a feel for the spectrum of willingness to be open-minded and willingness to change from person to person.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESometimes, an IL is not as open and willing as you\u2019d like. You have direct questions about their beliefs but they refuse to answer in a clear way, or they answer a different question than the one you\u2019re asking. These ILs are what I call \u201Csquirrely\u201D and can often test my patience. In comparison, when you eventually interview someone who is open-minded and open to change, it can feel akin to cutting soft butter with an extremely sharp knife. SE skills can feel like overkill with certain ILs, especially when you\u2019re chatting with an open-minded individual who values critical thinking but previously hasn\u2019t thought about their belief in depth.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis illustrates further how the immediate outcome of your chats is highly dependent on the openness of your IL. It\u2019s not all about you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003ETaking the pressure off yourself\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo me, it begins to seem that no matter the level of enthusiasm or preparation I have for an interview, as long as I do my job by mirroring thought processes and sincerely demonstrating uncertainty, successfully imparting doubt is less about me and what I do and say, and is more about the IL and what they think and value. That\u2019s a meaningful realization because it takes at least some of the pressure off me as a SE. Now, I can stop beating myself up when my wit catches up to me in the stairwell.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EMoving forward\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, what should Street Epistemologists do? How do we do our job to the best of our ability knowing: A) You aren\u2019t as good at SE as you will someday be, and B) The outcome of your interventions depends largely on your IL?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003ESimply walk through the door when it\u2019s open and have these conversations more often with more people when they present their beliefs. Be there to put the pebble in the shoe. Perhaps today is the day their laces aren\u2019t laced so tightly.\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003EListen to and repeat your IL\u2019s words. Compassionately mirror your IL\u2019s thought process.

Helping to create such moments and be a part of them is a ton of fun.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s personally fulfilling to me to work towards a world where people use sound methods of forming beliefs and willingly revise their beliefs on encountering new evidence. It happens when I realize I\u0027m wrong about something and update my own beliefs. It also happens when the person I\u2019m talking to begins to doubt or realize that the method they\u0027re using is unreliable.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSE works great in a talk about loosely-held beliefs, but the utility and enjoyment it can yield is even better demonstrated in conversations about deeply-held beliefs. It\u0027s a technique that can help the discussion to remain open and sincere by avoiding many of the ways a person can become defensive. That\u0027s important during a talk about a belief that may have formed much of their identity since childhood. It can follow the principle of \u0022first, do no harm\u0022 when it comes to valued relationships.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI did not expect much success when I first started incorporating this tool into my discussions with family, friends, and acquaintances last year, a few months after I stopped believing in God. So I was pleasantly surprised when one told me that they\u0027ve been completely rethinking their faith for the first time in 60 years because of our conversations.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThere tend to be more hurdles to jump over when I talk to people who already know that I\u0027m an atheist. They sometimes distrust my motives, just as I distrusted atheists when I was a believer, thinking that the devil used them to deceive believers. That makes it difficult to reach a point of genuine communication, but most of the time they quickly begin to feel at ease and open up. I get more questions from them than from strangers, so I\u2019ve had a lot of practice answering without derailing the conversation. They are more reluctant to say that they believe because of faith, so we work through the evidence-based reasons for a longer period of time first. It very often turns out that those are not really the main reasons for the belief. When we finally do get to faith, though, it\u0027s a great feeling. It\u0027s like getting to the boss level in a video game. A recent example is a discussion I had with a Christian friend:\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat are the main reasons why you believe?\u201D\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBecause we\u2019re designed to need God, and we\u2019re better people when we follow Him.\u201D\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat evidence would convince you that a different explanation is correct? How could you test your belief to make sure that it\u2019s true?\u201D\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t think you can create a test for that. We are the way we are. And I believe we\u0027re this way for a reason. By design. There are many reasons I believe that, but in the end, it\u0027s faith.\u201D\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you use faith that way in any other area of your life, outside of God?\u0022\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now that\u0027s an excellent and profound question.\u0022\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was exciting for me because it was one of those moments where you stop and think.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter I started talking to strangers, I was surprised by two things: just how common it is to have strong beliefs that are not founded on sound reasoning, and the sheer variety of such beliefs. In addition to religions I\u2019ve never heard of before like Kemet way of life, I\u2019ve run into beliefs in telekinesis, anti-vax, Bigfoot, spontaneous human combustion, anti-microwaves, ancient aliens, spiritual energy connecting the universe, and more. Yet despite this great dissimilarity in beliefs, the talks about them largely follow the same pattern because they are often based on the same underlying reasons.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople seem to genuinely enjoy the conversations, too. I\u0027m getting a lot of thank-yous and a recent session with a stranger ended with \u0022What you\u0027re doing is awesome. Keep it up!\u0022 I try hard to avoid saying something that might offend the other person because it often hinders the openness of the conversation or shuts it down entirely. But in one conversation with an old friend, I wasn\u2019t having much success in eliciting an explanation of how the methods he used to arrive at his God belief could be reliable, so I threw caution to the wind:\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Doesn\u0027t it bother you that the reasons you rely on to know that your beliefs are true are the very same reasons that terrorists rely on for their beliefs?\u0022\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n[Medium pause] \u0022But my reasons aren\u0027t the same.

So how can we learn SE and at the same time get feedback from other aspiring epistemologists in order to improve our skills and use them in our everyday life to the greatest extent possible? Start a local SE club, of course! And that\u0027s exactly what we did in Moscow, Russia, in May 2017.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe following describes the set structure of our weekly meetings and the work that occurs behind the scenes, with the main intention of inspiring the birth of new SE learning clubs around the world. It goes without saying that our particular structure is not the only one possible, and may very well not be the optimal one. And yet the one we have for the moment has gradually taken shape over the months, and it works pretty well for us and our visitors.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EPart 1. The Meetings\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EStart by introducing ourselves\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course we don\u0027t do that if there are no newcomers present, but there almost always are. So we say our names and why we do SE in a couple of words. This should take less than a minute for each person.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EDivide into groups\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe divide into two or more groups, one of which is for people who are new to SE. An experienced member gives an introductory speech about SE to the newcomers, answers their questions and maybe even offers to conduct a demonstration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003ESpecialised exercises\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople already familiar with the method usually practice SE by conducting dialogues with each other or participating in exercises to improve a specific aspect of their SE skill. An experienced moderator is usually needed. Here are a few examples of possible exercises:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E- Practice asking specific \u0022How\u0022 questions, assuming we already know the belief of an IL, her level of confidence, and her reasons for that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E- \u0026nbsp;Responding to different interlocutor behavior. The moderator can adopt the interlocutor role. For example being in a hurry, or being too emotional, or talking too much, or frequently changing subject.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E- How to respond to an interlocutor who gives a lot of different potential topics to discuss, and how to decide which topic of hers is most desirable for conducting an SE dialogue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, usually about an hour later, we take our first break, and after that we can mix the newcomers with everyone else.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003ERole-play SE dialogues\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is probably our main activity. We assign an epistemologist and an interlocutor, and we also assign at least one official observer of the talk - preferably one who knows SE rather well - to give feedback to an epistemologist after the dialogue. Many of the other attendees will also observe the interaction. We time the dialogue (usually no more than 10 minutes), the feedback, and the subsequent discussion (usually no more than another 5 minutes). After the dialogue the following happens:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E- First, the person playing the epistemologist tries to pass The Ideological Turing Test, explaining in their own words what the interlocutor believes and why. The interlocutor gives feedback on their accuracy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E- Second, the assigned observer gives feedback. This feedback has two aspects: one is about the content, such as the particular questions, and the other aspect is about form, such as how did the \u0026nbsp;epistemologist behave, what was good, and could be improved. For example, was she neutral enough? Did she press the IL too hard? Was her wording of the questions good? And so on. Sometimes there are two different observers to assess these aspects.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESuch feedback can be tremendously helpful in improving your SE skills. Everyone can look at the same dialogue from different angles, and think of better questions that could have been asked. Combining it all together can be a massive boost for all of the participants.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E- Thirdly, all the listeners can freely discuss that dialogue for another couple of minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen conducting dialogues we usually divide into several different mini-groups of 3-8 people. Sometimes we can do it in a group of more people if most of them are willing to just listen for the moment, but usually there are several people who are eager to participate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter the dialogues, which can take another hour or so, we have a second break.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EAdditional Activities\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe usually do a second round of practice dialogues, and at the end we give feedback about the meeting itself. We also have giveaway leaflets with some helpful SE info and links.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s how it usually goes. And here are some more ideas for meeting activities:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E- Watch and discuss SE videos together\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E- Brainstorm SE questions for your real life situations and dialogues\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E- Discuss the ways of promoting SE still further\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EPart 2. Behind the scenes\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHere we present some basic organizational tips for SE meetings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003ESpace\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s important where your meetings take place. Not only does it provide comfort to all of you, but it can also contribute to the stream of future participants if there are other visitors of the same place. For example, we are hosted by the local LessWrong community, in their pay-for-minute cafe which holds a huge variety of events for open-minded people interested in personal growth. They are our target audience, so it\u0027s very convenient. And we always make sure there are enough of our leaflets at the reception desk. Another important thing is that there has to be at least one separate room where people can practice SE, so that they would not be distracted by other people. More rooms may be needed depending on the number of people in your SE club.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EAnnouncements\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEveryone interested should have a possibility to be notified about the upcoming events. We have them in FB, VK (Russian social network) and Telegram, so everyone can choose the source which is more convenient to them. Pre-registration should also be considered if the expected number of people can exceed the capacity of the space you selected.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003ERegularity\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is optimal to have an event regularly at the same time and at the same place, so that less mental effort is required to visit it. We\u0027ve been having weekly meetings at the same time and place for more than a year now.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EFeedback forms\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should always try to improve the experience you\u0027re giving to your visitors, and in order to get more ideas about what to improve, feedback can be tremendously helpful. We have feedback forms both in paper form and online, and people can anonymously write anything they did or did not like about the event.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EPost-releases\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPhotos, videos, audios, ideas, links should be gathered and kept somewhere, optimally posted on social media.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003ETeam\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s important to have a management team, because not much can be done by one or two people. We have about 10 enthusiasts who are ready to help and develop SE in different directions. The team has to have regular conference calls or otherwise contact each other where members can exchange ideas about the development of the community and improving their ways.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003ECreating new content\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt some point there will probably be at least a couple of people from your team who are able and willing to write their own content on SE and it\u0027s nuances. It\u0027s great to have your own site or social media public page with your own useful content. And it\u0027s also great to keep in touch with members of the international SE community and to share your experience with them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003ETake care of your visitors\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring the event write down all the important information for later \u2013 promises of giving some links to someone, important feedback given in verbal form, the new ideas you have come across etc. Also remember to exchange contacts with all the interested people and respond to them afterwards, it will increase the possibility of them coming again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EWrite your checklists\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s useful to have checklists for all the important things not to forget. You can have a checklist for a host of the event, and another one for a moderator of a mini-group activity, and so on. These roles are not very difficult to perform, and it is useful to have a pool of candidates in place to substitute the primary hosts, if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EPromotion\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s always useful to promote your activities, so that more people could know about them. You can do it online \u2014 mostly through social media via posts, videos, links and management of the community. And also offline \u2014 through lectures and workshops.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EConclusion\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease don\u0027t be scared by the extensive list of instructions we\u0027ve given. You don\u0027t necessarily need to follow even half of them to start your first local SE club. We started with very few people and very little knowledge of how it\u0027s done and what to expect. It was a very long process of creating the experience we are now sharing here. And of course we\u0027re still refining the process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo go on and create your own local community! We believe that together we can make the world a better place. Well, our confidence level is around 90%, and it\u0027s totally falsifiable of course. But you get the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWritten by Rom Tarasov\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E"

I think we need do more to change the way secular students engage their peers. Too often, students resort to dismissive language rather than investigating the methods by which their friends arrive at conclusions. College students have enough struggles without the added difficulties that result from damaged relationships.\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember the first time I understood how effective Street Epistemology (SE) could become: \u201CHow could it be,\u201D I thought to myself, \u201Cthat I have wasted so much time arguing about the existence of a god that I missed a much greater opportunity? The world would be a better place if everyone used reliable methods to arrive at their conclusions.\u201D This realization was exhilarating because, \u201CAt last!\u201D I thought, \u201CI have found the method that I\u2019ve been looking for!\u201D It is my intention to share that appreciation for SE with students around the country. \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, I see many secular students using combative techniques in conversation with believers. Sometimes, by arguing with family members, students sever crucial supportive relationships. One should not have to risk one\u0027s livelihood to defend one\u0027s nonbelief. By learning SE, these students could hold respectful, effective dialogue and even strengthen their relationships. That said, even if you are skilled at SE, you might find it more difficult to keep a level head with frustrating family members than with friends and strangers.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, students only have a limited amount of time outside their studies and social lives. How can they still learn SE techniques, and practice them in a constructive manner? What does an organization practicing SE on campus even look like? I hope you find the remainder of this article to be helpful in answering these questions.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EFacebook Conversations\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStudents, like everyone, tend to be doxastically closed on social media. But, through social media, I think they could do a lot to challenge their peers\u2019 faith-based reasoning. For example, consider the following post:\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u201CHello friends! Preacher Chris Cruz once said, \u2018God doesn\u2019t want to be studied. He wants to be known.\u2019 I needed this reminder today.\u201D \n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow would you respond? If you followed some of the examples I\u2019ve seen online, you might shut down the original poster with an insult. Now, imagine if every social media user did the same thing. How much critical thought would be employed or modeled for the original poster? What\u2019s the likelihood of the original poster critically examine their sincerely-held belief as a result of your insult? The student Street Epistemologist should encourage fellow students to question potentially faulty reasoning methods instead of attacking people or their conclusions. Being doxastically closed from within will be the secular student\u2019s downfall. SE must be taught in secular clubs to provide a catalyst for critical thought and activate campus-wide intervention. \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EEpistemology Training\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a recent Secular Student Alliance at Jacksonville State University (SSAJSU) meeting, I gave a Street Epistemology training presentation. The most effective segments of the training were a combination of observation and guided hands-on experience. Here\u2019s the way I trained the club to use Street Epistemology:\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EI handed out the SE Flow Chart from \u003Ca href=\u0022http://damndad.com/street-epistemology-process-flow-chart/\u0022\u003Edamndad.com\u003C/a\u003E. It is a general guideline and by no means the only way to go about SE. For our purposes, however, it served as a quick and dirty \u201CHow-to\u201D guide for getting to the bottom of faith beliefs. \n\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWe broke down a short SE video by comparing the questions and answers from the video to the flow chart. At this point I further encouraged the future use of the chart, especially if one did not plan to study SE or secular literature.\n\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI asked two volunteers to roleplay as SE and Interlocutor (IL) in front of the entire club for 5 minutes. It was important that we allowed comments after this part to give reminders of missed cues or offer possible alternative responses.\n\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe entire club broke up into pairs to practice on each other for 5 minutes. \n\n\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarlier in the presentation, I encouraged a friendly and curious disposition. Near the end, I provided a list of resources such as this blog, the book \u201C\u003Ci\u003EA Manual for Creating Atheists,\u003C/i\u003E\u201D various YouTube channels, and the Atheos application. Now that we had completed a surface-level training, we couldn\u2019t wait to practice the next day at our \u201CStreet Epistemology Tabling Event.\u201D \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EUsing SE as a Club\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what is a tabling event? At Jacksonville State University, campus organizations are allowed to set up tables in the student commons building near the food court. Club members took turns manning the table and engaging passersby for \u201CA quick 5-minute chat,\u201D about a deeply-held belief. To clearly state the purpose of our table, we made a poster displaying these questions:\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u201CWould this campus be better if we all believed true things?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhy do you believe in a god?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIs everything you\u2019ve been taught, true?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022/assets/images/image00.jpg\u0022 style=\u0022float:right; width:40%;margin: 2em\u0022\u003E\nWe carried out dozens of interventions over the course of those six hours. There were times when four club members were conversing with students of various beliefs. They took up a lot of standing room near the food court! We gained a ton of positive attention. Imagine the Student Government Association\u2019s reaction when the Secular Student Alliance was generating more engagement than some of the largest organizations on campus! Most importantly, however, SSAJSU members were honing their ability to dig beneath surface level discussion about belief. The interlocutors even appeared to enjoy it!\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nNearly every intervention ended with a smile and a handshake. Many IL\u2019s shared that they thought SE was a beneficial concept. They appreciated that, for Street Epistemologists, the goal isn\u2019t to change minds; it\u2019s to foster a genuine curiosity as to how people come to their strongly-held beliefs.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I received feedback from the student Street Epistemologists, I discovered that for them, the most challenging part of the tabling event was interacting with IL\u2019s about their epistemology without becoming combative. Later, I contacted the group members through social media to reassure them. Even if they felt discouraged by their performance, it is very likely that the seeds of doubt they sowed are taking root over the course of many days and weeks.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EConclusion\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn conclusion, I urge you, the motivated student, to teach SE however you can. Give a presentation at your favorite club; stand with a sign outside the cafeteria door. And I urge you, the motivated community member, to reach out to your local campus. See if there is an organization that might be receptive to SE. Offer to speak or meet with their leaders, or pay for lunch with interested students. Why shouldn\u2019t Street Epistemologists help encourage the sincere examination of strongly-held beliefs? Together, we will continue to bring about tangible, positive change in our communities.

Not just any Southern Baptist church, but a small church planted firmly in the then relatively rural American South.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery Sunday morning for as long as I can remember, I\u2019d rise from my slumber, make my way downstairs in my pajamas to my Mom\u2019s breakfast of cream of wheat, and tune in to a syndicated episode of \u201CLost in Space\u201D on our tiny, black-and-white kitchen TV.  Then I would head back upstairs for a quick transformation into semi-formal Sunday clothes \u2013 which basically meant an outfit that landed somewhere between school clothes and a suit with a clip-on tie. I would then bid adieu to the Robinsons and the Robot, and, with my little King James Bible in hand, be whisked off to Sunday school.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI have fond memories of that church. Memories of me waiting for my parents to arrive for the main Sunday service, sitting alone in the pews after attending my Sunday school class. This was what one might call an old-time Southern Baptist church full of old-time religion. Old songs were sung from old hymnals by an old choir and to a fairly old congregation.  We sang \u201CHow Great Thou Art,\u201D  \u201COld-Time Religion,\u201D  \u201CNothing but the Blood of Jesus,\u201D and of course, \u201CAmazing Grace.\u201D  The pulpit was book-ended by an organist and a pianist and the preacher would always start low and end high with the zeal one would expect from a preacher with some of that old-time religion! For better or worse, whether it was that this church was only a few miles from where I grew up or whether it was some \u201Cspiritual\u201D connection my parents felt, this was our church.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI had ridden the peaks and valleys of weekly salvation and damnation for years. The whole emotional enterprise seemed to be going along just fine, but then something interesting happened. One Sunday when I was around twelve years old, I was given a Xerox copy of a list of bands and songs that I was, from that point forward, to consider as \u201Cdevil\u201D music. Yes, devil music. According to my church, listening to Led Zeppelin\u0027s \u201CStairway to Heaven\u201D was blasphemy. Anything by Black Sabbath was a one-way ticket to hell. Even Gary Wright\u0027s \u201CDream Weaver\u201D meant that I was astral projecting and thus opening a door for The Enemy! As a child of the seventies, I had been jamming to this music for nearly as long as I could remember. I had a KISS t-shirt when I was in the first grade for crying out loud! I adored most of the music on this sheet. It didn\u2019t make any sense. My young brain was set into analytical motion. I thought the whole thing was preposterous. I was not worshipping the devil. Regardless, getting this message from my quaint, bucolic church was a shock to my pious young system.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking back, it was around that time that I really started questioning the validity of what people in authority were telling me. I began comparing claims that did not rely on evidence with those that did. I was told that Adam and Eve and Noah\u2019s Ark were true stories, yet I watched documentaries about Lucy the Australopithecus afarensis on PBS\u2019 \u003Ci\u003ENature\u003C/i\u003E. I was told that my god created the universe, the Earth, and all its inhabitants in six literal days, yet I watched Carl Sagan explain the evidence for Big Bang cosmology on \u003Ci\u003ECosmos\u003C/i\u003E. I began to compare each claim I was told to believe without question to what could be supported using reason and evidence. I no longer relied on the earnestness or the authority of the person doing the telling; I wanted proof!\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFast-forward to today, and it occurs to me that I have promoted critical thinking by valuing reason and evidence my entire adult life. I have argued, debated, chatted, typed, tweeted, and talked about a whole host of beliefs that people maintain based on unreliable methods. Invariably, at the conclusion of many of these discussions, just when I thought I had hit a logic home run or a made an evidence slam dunk, my interlocutor would leave the conversation with even more resolve. But why? \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are reading this on the Street Epistemology blog then of course you already know why. \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFor years, I had been supporting my positions using reason and evidence, but I was missing the greater contextual picture: epistemology. I remember listening to a Dr. Peter Boghossian lecture on YouTube several years ago where he explained his idea of conducting a sort of \u201Cstreet epistemology.\u201D I was gobsmacked. All these years I had been trying to convince people that their claims were untrue by using methods that would have worked perfectly well on me. I was using reason and evidence on people who had formed beliefs based on something other than reason and evidence! Hence, the outcome was often an impasse, or worse, a doubling down on the mistaken belief. I now know that I was practically cultivating the backfire effect! I am reminded of the famous Thomas Paine quote from \u003Ci\u003EThe American Crises\u003C/i\u003E:\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u201CTo argue with a man who has renounced the use and authority of reason, and whose philosophy consists in holding humanity in contempt, is like administering medicine to the dead, or endeavoring to convert an atheist by scripture. Enjoy, sir, your insensibility of feeling and reflecting. It is the prerogative of animals.\u201D\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomas Paine needed some Street Epistemology! But I can appreciate Paine\u2019s frustration. Decoupling people from beliefs not grounded in reality is not a binary exercise. It\u2019s farming, not hunting. It takes time. It takes patience. I believe it takes practice. I have been deploying the techniques more and more frequently when speaking with people on a whole range of beliefs that do not comport with reality, and I am seeing hints of success.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom global warming deniers to people who believe demons are real, I am now trying to resist the old urge to ridicule as a means of retort and I am even trying to resist my knee-jerk reliance on evidence as the tool that might convince them they are wrong (see Paine above). I am now trying to help people recognize their own epistemic deficiencies. I want them to poke their own holes in the methods they are relying upon for determining what they believe is true. They have to change their own minds. I\u2019m now simply helping them clear the path. I have already noticed an improvement in results.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, in a recent Facebook exchange about politics (among the most futile activities one can imagine), and specifically, a conversation about how Donald Trump continues to make claims that are untrue, I was able to deploy a little Socratic SE to help my interlocutor understand the double standard with which he was excusing Trump\u2019s lies. The exchange went something like this. Trump had just tweeted something that was demonstrably untrue.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nMe: \u201CWhy do you think Trump would tweet something that\u0027s just incorrect?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nIL: \u201CBecause he is frustrated because the Dems are using childish tactics to hold up the government because they lost an election and lost seats.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nMe: \u201CDoes that mean it\u0027s OK to lie?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nIL: \u201CYou mean like every politician?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nMe: \u201CSo if I understand you correctly, you\u2019re actually OK with politicians lying because you expect that from them? I don\u2019t recall you making that same excuse for Hillary Clinton.\u201D\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nMy interlocutor disengaged and I did not press. I was not going to change his mind at that moment, but I was hopeful that I had done enough to cause him to reevaluate his own partisan bias. A few days later, he was actually posting criticisms of Donald Trump! I am not sure if I planted the seed of doubt that took root and sprouted into a single sprig of some healthy skepticism, or if it was something else, but I was again gobsmacked given my interlocutor\u2019s history of doubling down on his partisanship. \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nInterventions on Facebook, while accessible, may not be the most effective. That said, we are all learning as we go. If we can continue to plant seeds of good epistemology, no matter the medium and no matter the conversation, we can make progress. My next goal is to have a face-to-face conversation with a complete stranger. We should all set our own stretch goals that push us to extend critical thinking to those around us. It takes practice. \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFundamentally, I am looking forward to deploying Street Epistemology in conversations anywhere and everywhere, whenever I hear claims being made that are not supported by evidence. \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe journey, and hopefully the gobsmacking, continues!\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n-Ryan \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nRyan Bays is a writer, Dungeon Master, free-thinker, truth seeker, and unabashed promoter of critical thinking and scientific literacy.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSubscribe to his YouTube channel here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCENkdsCZsCft2occKqlWjXA\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCENkdsCZsCft2occKqlWjXA\u003C/a\u003E\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFollow him on:\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nTwitter: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/RLBays\u0022\u003Ehttps://twitter.com/RLBays\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFacebook: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.facebook.com/RLBays\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.facebook.com/RLBays\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nInstagram: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.instagram.com/ryan_bays/\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.instagram.com/ryan_bays/\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHis blog: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://ryanbays.com/\u0022\u003Ehttps://ryanbays.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\n\t\t\u003C/p\u003E"

I\u0027d amassed enough of a library of my stock responses to standard apologetics that I thought sharing those strategies could be beneficial to others. My tutorials and other articles have garnered about five thousand or so casual viewers worldwide thanks in no small part to some exposure from AronRa, the president of the Atheist Alliance of America. He\u2019s graciously given me a plug for an article I\u0027d written about him, Matt Dillahunty, and Seth Andrews for the Infidels.org website which lists Richard Carrier and some other prestigious names among their advisors.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI may need to pause here to go get a broom and clean up all the names I dropped. Sorry for that. My intent was to establish that, while it\u2019s only a hobby, the StupidAtheist.com website is something I take seriously, even when I\u0027m being frivolous about my seriousness.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople have written and thanked me for some of my notes on the way I handle certain arguments and, for everybody who has ever dropped me an email like that, I\u0027d like to offer a sincere \u0022Thank you.\u0022  I\u0027d also like to say, \u0022Please stop using most of the advice I\u0027d offered you. I think I was wrong. I think I may have been very, very wrong.\u0022\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Gosh, Stupid Atheist, how were you wrong?\u0022 some of you who apparently speak like kids from 1960s sitcoms might be asking. Forgive me, but I need to drop two more names:  Peter Boghossian and Anthony Magnabosco. \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nMr. Boghossian conceived, outlined, and I believe coined the phrase \u201CStreet Epistemology\u201D and Mr. Magnabosco subsequently became a black-belted ninja of the discipline. As gently as possible, Street Epistemologists simply want to plant a seed of doubt, sometimes referred to as \u0022leaving a pebble in their shoe.\u0022 It\u0027s a chess match, but an accomplished SE practitioner can make it look more like Tic-Tac-Toe.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nWatching hours worth of Boghossian and Magnabosco videos made it crystal clear what I\u0027ve been wrong about, and it\u0027s this: I was trying to use reason to counter the unreasonable. That\u0027s akin to fighting their asbestos suit with a flamethrower; they\u0027re just going to layer on more protection as things get hotter. And (as anybody in a relationship can attest) you can\u0027t simply scream \u0022YOU\u0027RE BEING UNREASONABLE!\u0022 and expect to score any points on your side of the argument.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact, we might need to consider abandoning the argument itself altogether, though perhaps not in every circumstance. Debating is fine in a formal debate setting. But for me at least (and a lot more of us, as the SE tactics gain traction, and subsequently, acolytes) it comes down to this:\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EIf you really want to change minds, you\u0027ve probably got to change tactics.\u003C/b\u003E\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my defense, I seem to have gotten it somewhat right in an article I\u0027d written titled \u0022You\u2019re an Idiot, But Don\u2019t Take It Personally.\u0022 Easier said than done, when the person you\u0027re having a conversation with keeps insisting your children deserve to spend eternity in torment just because you\u0027ve raised them to be critical thinkers. \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nBut you\u0027ve got to keep your cool, at all costs. You\u0027re talking somebody down from the ledge of irrationality. This is a fellow human being whose faith is like a band-aid. They may well suffer some pain at having it removed and recoil as a result. So be aware of that. Be sensitive to their sensitivity. And as the Prophet Aaron Rodgers told us in the book of NFL, Season 50, verse 2015: \u0022Relax.\u0022  \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nVerily.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nStreet Epistemology as I practice it lacks the actual \u0022Street.\u0022 I\u0027m more comfortable in the online realm, because it allows me the time to compose myself as well as my sentences. Maybe that\u0027ll change some day, but for now I\u0027m keenly aware that I lack the patience, fortitude, and frankly, the nads required to do this stuff face-to-face.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nNonetheless, some of my online encounters have begun to pay off. For the most part, I\u0027m a fixture in the Disqus chat forums used by a number of online news and blog services. My conversations can often be found in the Religion forum. And here\u0027s the weird part:  since adopting the Street Epistemology-esque tactics, I\u0027ve made more than a few devout friends online.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nInsofar as we (apostates and infidels in general) need to make inroads toward amending our image as abrasive buttholes, I think establishing these sorts of relationships is important. I\u0027ll use a conversation from this afternoon to tell you why. This isn\u0027t an SE exchange specifically, but it\u0027s one example of why the aftermath of those interactions is as important, I think, as leaving pebbles in shoes.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m typing this on Thanksgiving eve, and just got hailed by a Christian I\u0027ve spoken with many times who I suspect might be bipolar. He\u0027ll often get overheated by my inquiries, but I can usually calm him down by rephrasing questions, explaining that I\u0027m sincere in my curiosity, or by simply assuring him that no offense was intended and offering an apology. In any case, this is a guy who has told me on a number of occasions that he was done talking to me and that my family and I were doomed to a torturous eternity at the hands of his loving God, all the while peppering in a few not so \u201Clove-thy-neighbor\u201D-ly invectives for good measure.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFor your convenience, I\u0027ve copied and pasted our exchange from this afternoon below, with the name of the interlocutor (IL) changed as a courtesy to him.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nPete:  Long time no see! So you changed your picture. What happen to the A. [Note:  I\u2019d recently changed my avatar from an \u2018A\u2019 to a thumbnail of my eyeball.] Hope your [sic] having a great day.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nStupid Atheist:  You too, Brother Peter!

What it IS, though, is evidence that relationships can be formed with complete strangers despite our (sometimes vitriolic) differences, SE is a great tool for creating those types of common bonds rather than drawing divisive lines in the sand between us.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease understand, prior to adopting this sort of methodology, I routinely allowed arguments to emotionally escalate to the \u0027scorched Earth\u0027 level. Pooh-pooh the Bible all you like, but I am a HUGE fan of Hammurabi (\u201C...an eye for an eye\u2026\u201D and all that). If somebody else dropped their gloves, mine came off, too.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m confident that I\u0027m on a number of blocked/ignored lists as a result of my reactionary nature, and that haunts me. Those bridges are burnt and any chance I might have had to make a lasting connection is lost. Perhaps I won some arguments along the way, but I\u0027ve accomplished almost nothing toward winning hearts and minds, and those people I\u0027ve alienated may now be closed off to considering the value that any other infidel might bring to the table.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s tragic, and we shouldn\u0027t let it happen. I try earnestly to keep that in mind when things flare up emotionally.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a demonstrable payoff to that approach. A prolific Catholic apologist on Patheos often takes the time to respond in great detail to my honest, non-confrontational questions. Our latest conversation prompted two of his devout readers to engage me, and our conversations have gone on now at length. The last reader to chime in inserted themselves into the conversation with this statement:\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022... such a cordial discussion is a precious thing to read and of course some thoughts of mine pop up in my head.\u0022\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me, the fact that a Christian felt comfortable approaching an atheist stranger in a non-confrontational manner like that is itself a huge win. No, I haven\u0027t won an argument, I haven\u0027t one-upped the devout on any point of contention, but I\u0027ve won enough of their respect and attention to begin having a productive dialog in earnest which, on several occasions now, has resulted in humble introspections and even retractions from my new devout friends online. And I think that\u0027s huge.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EIf we\u0027re content to win hearts today, I think we\u0027ll have a far easier time winning minds tomorrow.\u003C/b\u003E\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nXapis...\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EAuthor Bio\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n The Stupid Atheist is a Cheesehead (resident of the state of Wisconsin in the USA) who had whatever potential for religious faith he might have had beaten out of him as a kid by Catholic nuns.

There is much more room for practicing Street Epistemology on politics, health and lifestyle topics. In this post I\u0027ve provided ideas to help you apply SE to secular topics and achieve more progress in conversations, in particular how to make ambiguous claims testable and also how to apply SE-style questioning to ethical claims.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EStart At The End\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEveryone wants to achieve their goals. On the one hand, your success is affected by having an accurate map of reality, and there your epistemology plays a key role. On the other hand, your goals follow from the values you hold dear, and there your ethical system plays a key role. And so we come to two tracks at the very beginning of the dialogue:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScientific track: \u003C/strong\u003E\u0026nbsp;The interlocutor (IL) says something clearly contrary to modern scientific understanding, examining IL\u2019s epistemology the classic SE way seems to be a good option. Questions of type \u201CWhat is really out there?\u201D fall into this category.\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEthical track:\u003C/strong\u003E \u0026nbsp;The IL talks about values, and so you look closer into the value system. Much like a belief, there might be contradictions, fallacies and delusions here worth exploring. Here the questions like \u201CHow should it be?\u201D are the most pertinent.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELet\u2019s take LGBTQ\u002B topic to illustrate. Consider the following statements that might be made by someone opposed to rights for gay families and how you might challenge them:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003E\u0022Children from gay families suffer from psychological disorders\u0022\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003E\u0022Gay couples are sinful/disgusting, therefore gay marriage should be banned\u0022\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn response to the first statement you might take the scientific track, and in response to the second you might take the ethical track. Let\u0027s now look more closely at the two tracks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EScientific Track\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe call this the scientific track because it\u0027s about testing ideas about the world or what causes something. Although scientists perform rigorous tests and take steps to counteract confirmation bias and other \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Epitfalls\u003C/a\u003E, non-scientists also test their ideas about the world all the time. To be clear, we\u0027re usually making sloppy tests with sample size 1 and rarely shout \u0022my hypothesis has been falsified!\u0022 when it starts raining after having decided not to bring an umbrella, but testing our ideas remains an everyday activity. For this reason, you can take the scientific track with an interlocutor without framing it in scientific jargon like the null hypothesis or falsification, but with appropriate everyday questions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETechniques you can use in order to tie meaningless claims to reality:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003E\u201CDoes the truth of the claim affect the experiences you do and do not \u003Ca href=\u0022http://lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Eanticipate\u003C/a\u003E?\u201D. If a claim does not affect expectations in any way, or the observations are not demonstrable, you might consider reformulating the claim or suggesting your IL to think about utility of such claims;\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003E\u201CHow could we distinguish the world where the statement is true from the one where it is false?\u201D is a variation of the question above.\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Mind_projection_fallacy\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EMind projection fallacy\u003C/a\u003E check. People tend to assume others value and perceive the world the same way they do. Such words as success, intelligence, influence, erudition, difficulty, respect, taste etc. are prone to misunderstanding.\u201CWhat do you mean by that?\u201D question should clarify the subtleties of the terms, and the question: \u201CCan others perceive or value the same thing differently?\u201D invites IL to seek alternative explanations. Also, sometimes the claim is actually not about the outer world, but about inner properties of the brain. \u201CIf there is a process in a brain that makes you feel that it is true, would you want to know?\u201D is a question I asked a free will proponent. Giving an example helps, too: \u201CIs there a chance that there is some mind trick behind this, like with white-and-gold or black-and-blue dress?\u201D\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003EComparison. In science, null hypothesis usually is that there is no difference between two alternatives. Without alternatives stating a null hypotheses might be a trouble. \u0026nbsp;Concerning the LGBTQ\u002B example, children from gay families should be compared to children from heterosexual families, and the underlying null hypothesis is \u201CSexual orientation of parents does not predict psychological disorders of children better than chance\u201D.\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003EReduction. The point of reduction is to substitute the initial question with one or more factual questions accounting for the initial one. Raising contradictions in factual questions may lead to a shift on the confidence scale concerning the initial, regardless of it being objective or subjective. To find out who was a better president, you can ask your IL which means he uses to justify his belief, and maybe suggest to select the most significant from the list of possible factors, such as scientific progress, economic achievements or improvement in other aspects like social welfare or culture. This might be a sequel of the \u201Cexpected observable consequences\u201D question. I should note that in case IL decides who was better mainly on the basis of liking or disliking, the ethical track is preferable.\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003EMetric. Introducing a measure teleports the discussion to just one step away from resolving the initial question. Continuing with LGBTQ\u002B example, the appropriate metrics might be frequency, duration or severity of pre-agreed list of disorders.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter you\u0027ve put the claim into a testable form, you can explore IL\u2019s epistemology the classic SE way. Or you can compile all the work into one final question:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003E\u201CIf you find out that, all else being equal, children have about the same frequency of disorders irrespectively of the sexual orientation of their parents, how would that information affect your confidence?\u201D\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EEthical Track\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESE primarily focuses on epistemology of claims about what is real or not, but you can take a related approach to addressing claims about what is right or wrong. There are a lot of harmful beliefs in morality worth inducing doubt on, where knowledge of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliabilism\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ereliabilism\u003C/a\u003E is just not enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd there consequentialism comes to the rescue. Simply put, consequentialism states that the better the state of the world the action leads to, the better the action is. Comprehensively explained \u003Ca href=\u0022http://web.archive.org/web/20161115073538/http://www.raikoth.net/consequentialism.html\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, I would like to introduce a few ideas from the article and how they can be incorporated in SE dialogue. Note that the text below is a system of intuitions of the author, not an expert judgement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EStrategy\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMost common problem I faced is that ILs gave only arguments which \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Esupported their own position\u003C/a\u003E, for example, death penalty advocates never payed attention to negative consequences. And the question \u201CDo you see any cons in death penalty?\u201D draws IL\u2019s attention to the other side of the problem, which often results in openness and shift on the confidence scale. There are more sophisticated cases where negative consequences have no effect on IL\u2019s confidence, though, so let\u2019s proceed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EHow do you know that it\u2019s good?\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESome people tend to use ways of justifying a moral belief in contexts where they may be unreliable, or where the quality of decision is crucial and speed is not. Like ways of knowing, e.g. personal experience or testimony in classic SE, these ways of evaluating actions should be questioned:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_heuristic\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EAffect heuristic\u003C/a\u003E. \u201CGay couples are disgusting, therefore gay marriage should be banned\u201D is the example of how this mental shortcut is used to justify a claim. If one did something on the basis of liking or disliking, does it mean he committed a good thing? Can one use disgust as a way to determine what to do and commit a bad thing?\n\n\t\u003Cul\u003E\n\t\t\u003Cli\u003EShame or guilt. If one feels bad after doing something, does it mean he did a bad thing?\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\t\u003Cli\u003EWarm fuzzies. If one feels good after doing something, does it mean he did a good thing?\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003C/ul\u003E\n\t\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003ESocial signaling. Observing a person doing something affects our expectation of him belonging to certain social groups. Some actions affect our confidence stronger than others. In particular, the more improbable the action is, given that the person does not belong to the social group, the bigger the effect is. Buying a diamond is a signal of wealth, because this purchase is not likely otherwise, as diamonds are made a little use of in households. If one did something to prove others he belongs to the social group, does it mean he committed a good thing?\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003EDeontology. \u201CHomosexual behavior breaks divine laws, and is therefore wrong\u201D falls into this category. If an action according to the rule leads to worse consequences than another action, why would you want to follow it? More information on this in the section below.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, traditional techniques like Outsider Test and Socratic Method can be applied to ways of determining what is good, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EDeontology\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDeontology is often set against consequentialism, as instead of judging an action on the basis of consequences the action leads to, deontology states that the better an action corresponds to a set of rules, the better the action is. The rules may be called \u201Ccommandments\u201D, \u201Cprinciples\u201D, \u201Crights\u201D, \u201Claws\u201D, \u201Cnorms\u201D, \u201Cstandards\u201D etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe central problem of deontology is the origin of rules, so don\u0027t confuse it with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism#Two-level_consequentialism\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Etwo-level consequentialism\u003C/a\u003E, where rules are based on consequences and result from the tradeoff between flexibility and reliability. For example, \u201CStealing is bad unless one has a good reason for it\u201D will likely lead to a worse state of the world than \u201CStealing is bad\u201D would. Furthermore, these rules may be overridden, if the proper examination of consequences produces better results.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, not all rules are consequences-based. Some claim divine origin or an underlying universal metaphysical \u201CLaw\u201D, and some are just floating without any non-arbitrary justification. Adherents of pure deontology, free of assessment of any real-world consequences, should be given a chance to perform that assessment themselves and become more aware of the disadvantages of their ethical system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003ENoncentral Fallacy\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPopular incarnation of deontology is \u003Ca href=\u0022http://lesswrong.com/lw/e95/the_noncentral_fallacy_the_worst_argument_in_the/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Enoncentral fallacy\u003C/a\u003E, for example, \u201Cabortion is murder\u201D. Supposedly, a person saying this keeps in mind the rule \u201Cmurder is bad\u201D. Abortion might have similarities with murder, and on the basis of these abortion is pronounced bad. The fallacy occurs mainly because of the assumption that all the murders are equally bad. Abortion is not a typical murder, so it might be good to ask: \u201CIs it a typical murder, like a mugger with a gun or maniac with an axe type of murder?\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you might challenge rule with consequences. \u201CDo you think that a woman who had abortion should spend, all else being equal, the same number of years in prison as a murderer?\u201D \u201CDoes it mean you expect there would be more positive and less negative consequences, if state passed the law equating abortion and murder?\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to deal with this kind of statement is to ask your IL to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalist_taboo\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ereformulate\u003C/a\u003E it without using certain words. \u201CThese words seem to bear a lot of luggage. Could you please tell me what you mean by that without using words \u201Cabortion\u201D and \u201Cmurder\u201D, so I can better understand what exactly you consider bad?\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EConclusion\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECasual conversations provide an excellent opportunity to gain SE experience and to help people revise their beliefs and get closer to the truth. I have shared a few insights on how to approach the discussion of \u201Cwhat there is\u201D and \u201Chow it should be\u201D, calling them scientific and ethical tracks respectively. I hope this information will help you enhance your mastery of SE, yielding more meaningful dialogues every day.\u003C/p\u003E"

As I have mentioned in other blog posts, if I think of anything to add later, I will append my thoughts in the comments section below.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nConduct a Self-Assessment\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople often say it\u2019s not in their nature to let egregious claims slide\u2014they absolutely \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E to make sure the other person is aware just how mistaken they are. \u201CI\u2019m simply incapable of letting people get away with it!\u201D is the explanation I often hear. Rather than give up completely, take a closer look at your strengths and weaknesses. Is there a particular type of person that tends to upset you the most? Is there a particular topic that makes you see red? Do you have expertise in a particular area and find those are the chats that trigger you most?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIdentifying which people or subjects have you struggling to maintain your composure will help you avoid those conversations and practice with safer topics for the time being. Recognizing that you always blow your lid when the subject of religion comes up, and yet you can easily keep your cool when discussing non-religious topics, can remind a person how rewarding productive dialogue can be overall.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter you complete a conversation, reflect on the effectiveness and feelings of goodwill you likely experienced. Remind yourself of these successes on easier subjects before you re-engage with people on topics that challenge your patience and keep progressing forward.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you relapse, revisit those earlier, successful dialogues and slowly work your way back up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nKnow When to Stop\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I reflect back on conversations where I deviated from SE and ended up debating, it\u2019s usually accompanied with the thought, \u201CI wish that talk ended 30 minutes ago when we reached that high point.\u201D In other words, I \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E having a respectful discussion, but then I didn\u2019t know where to go next or I was getting fatigued, got sloppy, and then ended up arguing with the person. To make matters worse, the little good that \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E happen was usually overshadowed by the embarrassingly bad blowout at the end.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo avoid dialogues turning sour, the first thing is to know your personal limits, so you can wrap up well before fatigue sets in. Also, watch out for gestures, words, or other indications that you or your conversation partner are starting to get heated. Crossed arms, aggressive hair flips, sighs of exasperation, and decreased or non-existent pauses between questions and answers could all be indications that it might be time to wrap up your talk.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your discussion is text-based, snarky remarks, sarcasm, disparaging memes, uppercasing words, or near-instantaneous responses back (which may suggest a lack of careful consideration) could also be an indication that a break is in order.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA simple, \u201CIt looks like things are heating up a bit and I\u2019m concerned it might get in the way of our mutual understanding. So, if it\u2019s alright with you, let\u2019s end the talk for now but pick it up soon. Sound good?\u201D Most people will agree to your suggestion, and many will take it as a kind gesture. If the person responds by goading you to continue or teasing you, that is absolute confirmation that you\u2019ve made the right choice to take a break.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u2019t allow anyone to pressure you into continuing in an unpleasant or confrontational dialog. It\u2019s always all right to gracefully exit a conversation.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAssess Your Goals\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe generally converse with people because we value these relationships and we think these individuals are worthy of being helped. It\u2019s usually in everyone\u2019s best interest to encourage people to reflect on their beliefs because we care about them, we want ourselves and others to hold accurate views of reality, and we recognize that a person\u2019s actions based on untrue beliefs can cause real harm.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo before you embark on your next SE talk, stop and ask what you are hoping to gain by engaging in a particular conversation. What is your objective by having a talk? What would you consider to be a success? How invested are you in the topic at hand? What repercussions might one expect from having a dialogue on this subject? Is it worth the time and effort to have a chat right now? Do I have time after the talk to be supportive if this person abandons their belief? Write your goals down or even share them with your interlocutor before stating the talk. Feel free to reference this list occasionally during the chat to ensure you are staying on track.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPay attention to your own motives and those of your interlocutor. One or both of you might enjoy debating and/or placing yourself in a competitive scenario where one must avoid \u0022losing\u0022 at all costs (whatever that means). Sometimes, simply hearing or thinking about the views of \u201Cthe enemy\u0022 can trigger an angry response. In these cases you have to prepare your own state of mind to view the dialogue as a peaceful collaboration and not a battle.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is also common for individuals to feel anger when discussing their former faith for some time after leaving a belief system. During that period it may be better not to engage with the more abrasive believers or those you\u0027ve had angry exchanges with in the past. You might even consider working with a professional therapist at the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.seculartherapy.org/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003ESecular Therapy Project\u003C/a\u003E to assist you in moving on. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EThey Could Be Right\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile at times this may seem far-fetched, remind yourself that your interlocutor could have a reliable epistemology and what they believe could be true, no matter how unlikely it seems to you in light of your current beliefs. Acknowledging your biases and striving to stay neutral during a talk is a great way to help a person stay emotionally detached from a conversation.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAim for inquisitiveness rather than aggressiveness. Model the openness you want your interlocutor to exhibit with your own candor and sincerity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMind the Backfire Effect\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMany select Street Epistemology as the approach of choice because we wish to avoid the \u201Cbackfire effect,\u201D the phenomenon where a person responds to attacks, facts, and counter-evidence by becoming even more entrenched in their views. Ask yourself, \u201CIf I respond with that, will it be harder or easier to continue making progress with this person?\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERemind yourself that slipping into \u201Cdebate mode\u201D during a one-on-one talk will almost certainly impede your conversation and trigger that flight-or-fight reaction. \u0026nbsp;This is so critical that you might consider keeping around this actual MRI image highlighting the amygdala in green and insular cortex in yellow, as a visual reminder to avoid triggering \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala_hijack\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Eamygdala hijack\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ccenter\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MRI image highlighting the amygdala in green and insular cortex in yellow\u0022 src=\u0022https://StreetEpistemology.com/img/52/mri-image.jpg\u0022 style=\u0022height:200px; width:193px\u0022\u003E\u003C/center\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf a visual reminder like this could help you stay on track, print it out and tape it to your monitor, make it the wallpaper on your phone, or update your profile image during the course of an online discussion. Your brain and the brain of your conversation partner are going to respond in much the same way, so be aware of your own tendencies to hunker down when \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou\u003C/strong\u003E are being confronted with ideas that do not fit your preconceived notions.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile your conversation partner may not be familiar with the \u201Cbackfire effect,\u201D you now are, so the responsibility will likely fall on you to be aware of the potential pitfalls.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EA Slice of Pie\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne source of conversational frustration is finding that the dialogue has looped back on itself, or not knowing exactly where to go next. Creating a reminder of the SE questions you wish to ask will likely help keep you from getting you worked up and resorting to your old, argumentative ways.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my talk to Chicago Atheist Society called \u2018\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/crHkQ93hizE?t=12m27s\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EThings I Have Learned\u003C/a\u003E\u2019, I discuss three categories of questions that usually come up during an effective SE-based talk. Grouped by importance, not frequency, remind yourself that you are striving to understand \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhat\u003C/strong\u003E a person believes (~10 percent), their justifications (\u003Cstrong\u003Ewhy\u003C/strong\u003E) for the belief (~20 percent), and \u003Cstrong\u003Ehow\u003C/strong\u003E they determined that their methods for arriving at the belief were reliable (~70 percent).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that these percentages are not based on carefully calculated conclusions, but are merely trends I\u2019ve noticed after participating in and reviewing hundreds of SE-based talks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ccenter\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Pie chart: What, why, how.\u0022 src=\u0022https://StreetEpistemology.com/img/56/what-why-how2.jpg\u0022 style=\u0022height:179px; width:234px\u0022\u003E\u003C/center\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you find yourself becoming irate at your interlocutor, return to asking the more basic what-type questions, and then slowly build back to the why- and how-type questions, which will require more listening and patience. Revisiting \u003Cem\u003Ewhat\u003C/em\u003E a person believes gives your conversation partner a chance to further explain their beliefs, will likely be perceived as genuine interest (which can foster goodwill), and gives you a little bit of time to regain your composure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPretend There\u2019s an Audience\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the main things that helps me keep cool when I\u0027m growing frustrated with an interlocutor is reminding myself that other people may very well be watching. \u0026nbsp;Whether I am livestreaming over social media or recording a talk to upload later to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.youtube.com/magnabosco210\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Emy YouTube channel\u003C/a\u003E, I have to remind myself that my behavior is being observed very closely by lots of people (and not just by those who share my views).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u2019s very common for people to leave a comment on a video or message me directly to point out something that I said or did after watching one of my interactions. For example: \u201CNever offer to shake a Muslim woman\u2019s hand!\u201D, \u201CWhy did you pronounce the word \u2018epistemology\u2019 slower for those two ladies?\u201D, \u201CDon\u2019t \u003Cem\u003Etell\u003C/em\u003E people to have a nice day; you should say that you hope that they have a nice day!\u201D, \u201CYou were awfully abrupt with that guy. Is something bugging you?\u201D, and so on. At first, this was a little off-putting and I could feel myself getting defensive: \u201CHow dare they judge me! Show me a video of \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E trying this!\u201D But as time progressed, I began to discover not only the value of this feedback, I began to realize that having people watching me was in fact helping me stay more calm, cool, and collected \u003Cem\u003Eduring\u003C/em\u003E the encounter!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEven when engaging in a conversation that is not being recorded or broadcasted, I try to imagine what an audience watching the encounter might think. By pretending that others (from impressionable youngsters to my peers to my heroes) are intently watching my every move, I can usually dial back my frustrations considerably.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next time you start up a discussion, pretend that you and your interlocutor are standing on a stage in front of a large audience. Imagining this scenario should help you stay emotionally distanced from the topic being discussed and should keep you on your best behavior. In turn, your questions will probably seem less like an attack and more like an exciting, mutual exploration of ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSee Victims, Not Victories\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERather than view your interlocutor as an enemy opponent or competitor in a contest, try to remind yourself that they are probably a nice person who just happens to be holding a mistaken view of reality. Many people have never been taught how to think critically, and simply lack the skills necessary to adequately question their belief claims. People like this are probably not stupid or deluded. They are merely unwitting victims of a faulty epistemology. We are obligated to try and help them!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReminding myself that no one is immune to this mental trap\u2014even me\u2014has been immensely helpful in keeping my cool when I encounter someone who is pushing all of my buttons. It\u2019s also a bit liberating to recognize how easy it is to be mistaken, and that it\u2019s alright to say, \u201CYou know, I\u2019m really not sure why I think that\u2019s true!\u201D Viewing your conversation partner as a casualty of the fickleness of the human mind, rather than a foe who must be crushed, is extremely helpful in keeping those angry emotions at bay.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCreate a Decompression Plan\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy preparing for yourself a plan for dissipating your frustration after the dialogue, you may find it easier to keep your cool during the dialogue itself.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter my nearly 30-minute long talk with an on-campus \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/Tkpz5btDdgM\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EChristian minister who spouted all sorts of ridiculous things,\u003C/a\u003E I waited until we shook hands, wished each other well, and he walked away before suddenly venting my frustration to the (probably now shocked!) livestream audience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing able to disclose your conversation to others is essential, so give some thought as to which people in your circle can hear you out. Sometimes, simply making a tweet or post in one of the SE-based Facebook Groups about your experience will be enough to help get things off your chest and be more refreshed for next time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI have learned to leave the frustration, sadness, and pity I often experience from my chats out in the field. I don\u2019t \u003Cem\u003Ewant\u003C/em\u003E to take it home with me. I have far too many conversations with people these days to become emotionally invested in them. And while that might seem heartless, I\u2019ve decided that I cannot and do not wish to burden the loved ones in my life with such things.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is worth repeating: \u003Cstrong\u003Enever\u003C/strong\u003E direct your frustration at your interlocutor. Hold and get it off your chest later.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPrepare Yourself for Change\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EComing to the realization that my own anger could be the biggest barrier preventing me from conducting an effective SE-based talk has been both humbling and motivating.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHumbling because I can look back and see how becoming aggressive has hurt feelings and damaged relationships, and motivating because this is one of those rare times where there is a factor that I actually have some degree of control over.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese days, if someone starts to become irate with me, I\u2019ve found that it is now difficult for me to match their anger. And it\u2019s more than realizing that they will likely ramp things up even further if I did. If anything, I find myself becoming curious as to why they might be responding in such a heated manner and then sincerely offer to investigate their response if they are willing. People have asked me if I use mindfulness meditation to stay so calm, and yet I don\u0027t meditate. \u0026nbsp;Maybe this is a hidden benefit of practicing Street Epistemology, of cultivating a Zen-like calm in an otherwise difficult situation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI have received countless notes from people over the years saying how much learning SE has had on improving their own temperament, conversations, relationships, and overall outlook on life. It\u2019s truly inspiring to hear such things.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I can definitely relate to this feedback because I often feel this way about my own interactions and personal growth\u2014it\u2019s one of the things that inspires me to pour nearly everything I have into practicing and promoting this approach.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nClosing\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is my hope that these suggestions and anecdotes will help you stay more focused and calm when you embark on your Street Epistemology conversations. While I still struggle occasionally, these concepts have absolutely helped me improve in more ways than one.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u2019t expect to see improvements immediately. These things take time. Continue to remind yourself about your objectives, the things you can do when you detect that anger rising, and the feelings of satisfaction one can experience when you have helped someone honestly reflect on a deeply-held belief.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.twitter.com/magnabosco\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EAnthony Magnabosco\u003C/a\u003E is a provisional atheist as well as a promoter and practitioner of Street Epistemology.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E"

In my case, I never expected that my first time doing Street Epistemology would be with a 71 year-old man. Yes, it was awkward and often halting and fumbling. It was, at times, embarrassing and in the end, not completely satisfying. Yet after my first experience, I know that I want to do it again and again with many and varied dialogue partners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowing such experience, I\u0027m ready to dispense free advice to those anyone wanting to try Street Epistemology for the first time:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cem\u003EConsent is critical\u003C/em\u003E \u2013 First time or fiftieth time, make sure your to be clear about your intentions, and seek the consent of your partner to have a dialogue in which you ask questions about how they arrived at a belief. Whether someone you know or someone you have just met, you can obtain consent in a casual way as you build rapport.\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIt\u2019s just not the same online\u003C/em\u003E \u2013 Before my first face-to-face dialogue I had been practicing Street Epistemology online for more than a year, mostly via email or Facebook messaging. It wasn\u0027t really SE though, often devolving into debate and my dialogue partners would eventually stop replying, without wrapping up the dialogue.\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWatching videos is nothing like the real thing\u003C/em\u003E \u2013 I watched a lot of videos on YouTube and even produced a few breakdowns of my favorite videos from Anthony Magnabosco and Reid Nicewonder. While videos give you ideas of what to do, they are far from the real thing. You know your skill only when you are forced to perform.\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cem\u003EYou don\u2019t have to go all the way\u003C/em\u003E \u2013 I\u0027ve learned that it\u0027s ok pull out of the conversation if you find yourself regretting your choice of partner. If your partner is very inexperienced, failing to distinguish between believing and knowing or thinking that all truth is relative, you may have to keep it at first base with simpler examples like the Tic-Tacs or the Ferrari keychain.\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cem\u003ETake it slow\u003C/em\u003E \u2013 You may be so anxious to try SE for real that you are at risk of moving too fast. Don\u2019t rattle off a series of questions you\u2019ve been dying to ask. Truly listen to your partner and allow plenty of time for pauses.\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cem\u003ERecording it, if you\u0027re into that\u003C/em\u003E \u2013 If you want to record you may find it awkward if you\u0027re not well prepared, especially in spontaneous encounters. I\u0027ve tried using smartphone voice memos, not for posting but just to evaluate myself. Be aware you should never record or publish without the informed consent of your partner.\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAccept that you will probably be terrible at first\u003C/em\u003E \u2013 If you feel unsatisfied at the end of the conversation, your partner probably feels similarly. That\u2019s okay: a lot of it depends on your partner, and with practice and constructive feedback, you can improve.\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThink about what you did right\u003C/em\u003E \u2013 While I wasn\u2019t perfect, when I listened to my conversation I realized that I did focus primarily on my partner. I let some things slide and missed opportunities for probing questions, but it went better than I expected.\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAsk if you can get together again\u003C/em\u003E \u2013 I had invited my dialogue partner to an astronomy event where I would be speaking on critical thinking. He didn\u2019t show and it left me wondering whether the conversation had made a positive impression. Maybe I planted a pebble in a shoe, but I may never know, and have to be okay with not knowing.\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDon\u2019t rush into the next experience\u003C/em\u003E \u2013 Whether your first-time experience was terrific or so-so, don\u2019t feel pressured into doing it again until you are ready. Being ready requires knowing why you are doing it in the first place. What if you are just trying to feel like you have the truth? That\u0027s no good for your partner. Try watching how others do it and learn from them how to make the experience more satisfying for both of you.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\t\u0026nbsp;\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMortgage Hill Musings makes a living teaching science concepts.

The discussions were just as profound, revealing, and emotional as the ones you can find on my YouTube channel.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nTo date, every Street Epistemology-based conversation I have filmed and uploaded has been with strangers, usually someone that I have just met for the very first time. The talks are also what I call \u0022interview style.\u0022 That is, they are less a back-and-forth conversation and are carried out more like an inquisitive researcher interviewing an energetic subject.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThrow in a clipboard, a timer, and perhaps a video recorder, and you get the idea.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I absolutely \u003Cem\u003Eenjoy\u003C/em\u003E conducting \u201Cstreet\u201D Epistemology where the talks are initiated. I never know what belief a person will choose to discuss or which direction the talk will go. I also get to hone my skills, and it\u2019s incredibly rewarding when your interlocutor later exclaims, \u201CThat was the best talk I\u2019ve had with someone in a very long while!\u201D\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003ESituational Awareness\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the approach of SE with family and friends is the same as strangers\u2014focus on the \u0022how\u0022 and less on the \u0022what\u0022 and \u0022why\u0022\u2014the dynamics are drastically different. Strangers (particularly if they are being recorded) will often be more wary of your objectives. After all, you probably just met and have only spent a few minutes getting to know each other, if that.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFor some, speaking with family members is advantageous; you\u2019ve built rapport over countless hours, can easily read each others\u2019 body language, and the chance of meeting again to resume the discussion at a later time is high.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople who are close to you will also have a much better idea of who you are: your history, what you believe, and perhaps even what you think of their beliefs. This can get further complicated if you attempted to discuss their beliefs in the past and things became heated. Even if your previous discussions didn\u0027t go well, I still think most people can recover from that by shifting gears and employing a little \u0022off-street\u0022 epistemology.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes, simply acknowledging your past difficulties and offering to revisit the subject from another approach could be all it takes to re-engage with your mom who thinks the Bible is true because it is without error. Giving it another try using SE could possibly begin to repair a relationship that may have been damaged by more confrontational approaches.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, how would your loved one react if you said, \u201CI realize things got a little difficult the last time we chatted about this, but if you\u2019re okay with it, I\u2019d like to have a more respectful dialogue. Essentially, ask questions to better understand your position. Would that be acceptable?\u0022 If they demur, feel free to explain that you\u2019d like to try using Street Epistemology. Don\u2019t hesitate to tell them all they want to learn about the method; there is nothing to hide.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember that SE works best when you are being neutral. Of course, with family members and friends, they\u0027ll probably know your position on the topic at hand so it may be difficult to assure them that you will try your best to be open to their views. Acknowledge your biases (we all have them) and clarify your goals. For example, \u201CWhile I don\u2019t believe in any Gods, I really want to understand how you concluded that your belief is true. I\u2019m willing to set aside my views as best I can in order to sincerely hear you out.\u201D\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nA good way to demonstrate your commitment to being impartial is to share a time when you believed something, but later learned that you were mistaken. For example, explain how uneasy you felt when you were incorrect about something, and later, how great it felt when you no longer held that mistaken belief. By framing the discussion as a joint effort to discover truth, you may find that the resulting conversation brought everyone involved closer together.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother factor to consider is the venue where you plan to have your discussion. Would a coffee shop be better than a long-distance car ride? What kind of noisy distractions might disrupt your talk? Will other people be around to interject and possibly throw things off-track?\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my experience, a one-on-one talk in a quiet location without tight time constraints will yield the best results. This allows you both to set the pace, take breaks, and let the discussion unfold naturally. If possible, turn off the electronics and dedicate yourselves to a leisurely, uninterrupted conversation.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile a quiet place is ideal, you may not have this luxury and will just have to work with your environment. Perhaps Mom\u2019s phone rings just as you were about to ask your most thought-provoking question, or Sister\u2019s baby wakes up and is ready for his feeding. Your friend\u2019s car alarm starts to go off. When/if these things happen, jot down where you left off and try to resume the dialogue or schedule another time to meet again. \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep in mind that Street Epistemology works best when people take time to think about the talk on their own, so don\u2019t get discouraged if you have to wrap things up unexpectedly.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003ERaised Stakes\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA botched conversation with a stranger, while awkward, can be easily forgotten. It can be merely a blip on the radar, or an experience that helps you improve for the next talk, becoming something you can laugh about later.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, when it comes to the people you know, love, and/or care about, the stakes are much, much higher. Your marriage, your relationship with kids, your job\u2014everything that you have surrounded yourself with over the years could be at risk by deciding to have a talk about your loved one\u0027s deeply-held belief, be it about a God, law of attraction, karma, conspiracy theories, politics, etc.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo first, before proceeding, you need to be honest with yourself about your objectives: What am I hoping to accomplish here? Why do I care what they believe? What\u2019s the worst-case scenario? What is my definition of a successful talk? Is the potential fallout worth the effort? Can I be true to myself if we don\u2019t conduct this much-needed conversation? Is their belief a deal-breaker in our relationship? Can I learn to accept their belief and move on?\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are just a few of the many questions one must honestly ponder before deciding to engage a loved one on their cherished belief using Street Epistemology.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd remember that this conversation is not just about you. The discussion includes a person you likely care very deeply about. While identifying your personal goals beforehand is wise, continue to cater the discussion to the needs of your interlocutor. This is an effort to understand their methodology and discover together if it is as sturdy as they have come to believe.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother option to consider before talking with the important people in your life is to practice beforehand. There are a \u003Cem\u003Eton\u003C/em\u003E of Street Epistemology training resources available today.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFamiliarize yourself with the growing number of video examples of SE on YouTube. Read the Street Epistemology Guide. Install the \u003Cem\u003EAtheos\u003C/em\u003E app on your mobile device. Having co-facilitated more than 10 group sessions over video chat, I have found that role-play is a great way to prepare yourself for a discussion with a loved one. I suspect you could easily find somebody in the Private Street Epistemology Facebook Group who is willing to conduct a mock SE session while you pretend to be your spouse, or vice-versa.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EToo Hot to Handle\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes the belief in question is just too sensitive to bring up, even after cautiously considering all of the suggestions listed above. This is completely understandable, so don\u2019t be too hard on yourself if you are in this predicament. It\u2019s very common.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve been told of situations where the mere idea of suggesting a conversation about a loved one\u2019s God belief resulted in tears and nights on the couch. Beliefs in a deity are particularly tricky because they are so closely tied to one\u2019s own self-identity. Questioning your husband\u2019s belief in Jesus can be perceived as a direct attack on who he is as a person. This is not limited to him; others who share his belief may see your inquiry as a direct threat to who they are as people. \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the circumstances are this delicate, I suggest setting aside the sensitive topics for the time being and have a Socratic discussion about safer claims: Why do you think red cars get more speeding tickets than other ones? What made you think this pizza place has faster service than their other location? How did you conclude this lucky rabbit\u2019s foot would help sell our car? Could bringing sand home from Hawaii really put a curse on our family?\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nStarting with benign, everyday beliefs will not only help your loved one begin to become accustomed to examining the beliefs they hold, but you will also become more proficient with your questions. Your best friend is far less likely to close down in a conversation about why she believes paper bags are better for the environment than plastic ones, because her identity is probably not tied to the belief. These exchanges will likely help her become more comfortable with your method of inquiry, particularly if you have several discussions on a variety of safer topics.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf selecting beliefs to examine that your interlocutor holds cuts too close to the bone, still try to have a discussion together, but make it about someone else: What are your thoughts about the new signage they put up at the store? Do you think Jim\u2019s claim that he can cut his lawn faster with his new lawn mower is true? Why do you think our new neighbors decided to become Wiccans? \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a few talks like this, encourage your interlocutor to \u201Cturn the tables\u201D and respectfully challenge \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E on a belief. You could even agree to pick a belief that you once had, and role-play what that conversation might have looked like. Model the openness and curiosity you would like to see in your friend, and ask her afterwards what she thought about the exchange.\nOver time, your loved ones may begin to start performing \u201Cself-interventions\u201D when they are alone with their thoughts, and may become more open to the idea of examining their sensitive core beliefs. \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nResist the temptation to fast-track this process. It could take \u003Cem\u003Eyears\u003C/em\u003E to encourage your spouse or friend\u2014particularly if they have been discouraged to question things in the past\u2014to value and use Socratic inquiry. Always be on the lookout for opportunities in your everyday activities to re-introduce critical thinking and introspective inquiry.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u2019s also important to reward your partner\u2019s skepticism when you notice it. But don\u2019t go overboard; you don\u2019t want to come across as condescending. Try to find that perfect response that acknowledges when they expressed doubt on a claim, but don\u2019t make too big a deal out of it. Something simple might be all you need. For example: \u201CHmm. That\u2019s a great question, honey. I also wonder how they determined that this toothpaste reduced cavities by 30 percent!\u201D\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have children, you can easily turn their inquisitiveness into a fun learning experience. Something as simple as, \u201CHey kids! I just saw a flying saucer land in the park across the street!\u201D could lead to an hour of fun dialogue where you encourage them to question your claim.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003ELeverage Community\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, take advantage of the growing secular community that is getting behind Street Epistemology. Support groups like Recovering from Religion (RFR) have offered SE resources to people looking for ways to have more productive talks with believers. RFR has a wonderful phone and chat service where you can talk with a trained volunteer who will listen and be a sounding board for your concerns.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nMany atheists familiar with SE are married to believers, they work with believers, and have friends and family who are believers. In an effort to bring people who have more experience with these sensitive situations together with folks who are just starting to get into it, a \u201Csecret\u201D Facebook Group has been created. This group is a wonderful community for non-believers looking to have more effective talks with the loved ones in their lives, and I urge you to consider joining by \u003Ca target=\u0022_blank\u0022 href=\u0022mailto:emergingfaithhelp@gmail.com\u0022\u003Eemailing\u003C/a\u003E to start the application process.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease contact me directly if you found this article lacking in any way. Going forward, this post is where I will direct people who contact me when they are are looking for ways to talk to their loved one about their deeply-held beliefs.

I truly appreciated how the methods used in SE are flexible and it really helped my son in his development of critical thinking and scepticism.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERaised in an Anglican church in Yorkshire in the north of England was, for me, mostly a pleasant experience. I still relish the words of the written eucharistic prayer, revel in swimming through the ocean of noise from the church organ and would so happily sit and have a sweet (although inevitably weak) cup of tea with those old ladies and gents whose lives and stories fascinated me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI have had to spend a lot of effort, time and energy understanding how to question ideas. As a Christian, I would have told you that we were always encouraged to ask questions. As an example, we had a youth Bible study with a nearby church group and the purpose of this was to question everything. But hindsight shows me that the questions we asked, as you would expect, presupposed a God existing and the purpose of the study was to find ways to strengthen our faith and give us the feeling of having our reasons depository filled up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI am now a married adult with three young boys (9, 4 and 1). I have seen the vast majority of Street Epistemology videos and seek out and admire the work of Anthony Magnabosco and other practitioners. I feel equipped with real tools that affect the way I think about my own thoughts and beliefs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI was told as a child what to believe and taught it as the truth. I didn\u2019t want to likewise \u201Cbrainwash\u201D my children, telling them that they should be atheists. For this, I needed instead to provide them with ways to develop their critical thinking skills, to question things in meaningful and effective ways and to look bigger than what\u2019s just in front of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut how on Earth are we supposed to go about doing this\u203D I still don\u2019t know the answer to this fully, but an opportunity came to go a few metres down this path not so long since.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe week lockdown started in the UK was the week we bought a hot-tub.

We were having one of those rambling conversations that goes from one thing to another and there\u2019s certainly no way for me now to know how we got onto it, but he simply said \u201CYeah, but ghosts probably exist.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHalf of my brain yelled \u201CBy heck lad \u2013 you serious?!\u201D and the other half shouted \u201CThis is my opportunity!\u201D.

I explained.\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003EWe discussed the concept of falsifiability and he gave me the example of ghosts in his way of explaining falsifiability and the issues here.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the conversation, which, granted, was long and deep, he said his brain was like a tangled mop head. I had reached the end of this conversation and perhaps ought to have seen the need to do so sooner. I quickly asked him about his percentage and he said \u201Cjust under the 50%\u201D. I felt initially downhearted, as I wanted to rapidly get him to a similarly low percentage level as me, however I am reminded of how I know this is potentially an unreasonable wish and how a sudden and confident \u201CYeah I\u2019m 0% now\u201D might have led me to think he either hadn\u2019t grasped the concepts we were discussing or might have been flippantly throwing out this number with little thought.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, two or so days later, he came to me after tidying his room and said the following, and again, I paraphrase, but the essence is the same\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201CRight dad \u2013 I\u2019ve been thinking about the ghost stuff we were talking about and I think I\u2019m now at 5-10%. I know that the books and films aren\u2019t good evidence, but they must stand for something, however small.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI adore my son and this conversation was just great. He was eager to embrace the topic and I was able to discuss this more in future discussions. I loved how he kept stopping during the discussion to consider questions asked or to find ways to clarify or vocalise his own thoughts. I was really pleased with how he seemed to enjoy these conversations and how he likewise enjoyed being challenged on his ideas. Analogies to equivalent topics was an incredibly useful tool.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI hope to be able to have similar discussions in future about this and other topics and I think he would enjoy doing so.

However, out of concern that my wife might simply read the title and misconstrue my goals in asking her questions about her belief in god, as well as her request that I respect her belief, I had been hiding the book for some time for fear of my wife\u2019s reaction. Well, one evening, I slipped up and left it lying out. Understandably, my wife, upon finding the book, was quite upset and was convinced after reading the title and some of the chapter headings that I was disingenuous and I was actually seeking to de-convert her from her faith. She had become convinced that I was not merely a seeker of truth, but that I was secretly plotting to proselytize for atheism.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter giving my wife some time to cool down, I tried to assure her that the goal of Street Epistemology is not to \u201Ccreate atheists.\u201D Rather, it aims to help people see where they are using unreliable paths to truth, then lead them to instead embrace good epistemology: logic, reason, evidence, and critical thought. The title itself, \u003Ci\u003EA Manual for Creating Atheists\u003C/i\u003E, as well as Dr Boghossian\u2019s metaphors such as \u201Cthe faith virus\u201D and \u201Cremoving the disease of faith\u201D can certainly be off-putting and unnecessarily confrontational.  The title is based on the idea that when people start using reliable epistemology instead of unreliable epistemology, that \u003Ci\u003Eshould\u003C/i\u003E result in atheism, absent other factors motivating them to hold on to belief. So, someone who thinks good epistemology leads one to God should be unconcerned. Understandably, though, as she feels her Christianity is a core part of her identity, she was put off by the title and the chapter headers. Combining all this with the fact I was hiding the book from her, it\u2019s easy to see how this could make her feel betrayed and upset. At this point, I was in an emotional panic. Would my wife leave me and take the kids? Would she denounce me and out me to other friends and family as an atheist, as I am out to her but not to most of my family and friends? \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThankfully, I was able to shelve those thoughts. But first, I had to de-escalate the situation before I could make my case. Firstly, I reflected her feelings by paraphrasing her concerns back to her. I said, \u201CSo, after seeing this book, you now feel that my goal is to create more atheists, correct?\u201D Secondly, I showed that I appreciated her voicing those concerns to me: \u201CI\u2019m glad you shared this with me and I appreciate your willingness to talk through this.\u201D Thirdly, I empathized with her: \u201CI imagine you must feel betrayed, as I initially felt when I saw Leslie Strobel\u2019s book, \u003Ci\u003ESurviving a Spiritual Mismatch in Marriage\u003C/i\u003E, on your e-reader.\u201D\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, I began to calmly discuss the topic with her, using some of the tools I had learned by watching various Street Epistemology videos. I asked her, \u201CIf my goal was to simply proselytize and create atheists, would I have been willing to pray for knowledge of God and then proceed to read the Gospel of John as my former teacher suggested I do? No, I would not have done that as a sign of good intentions and modeling openness.\u201D She then conceded that no, I would not have done so. Then, I reaffirmed to her that my goal is to live an honest, truthful life, and that in order to do so, I had to examine whether my method for determining truth was reliable and sound. We went on to have a heartfelt discussion and amicably agreed to respect each other, despite our differences in religious views. As a demonstration of good intention, I agreed to pause my reading of this book and start reading a book about parenting an autistic child, for our daughter\u2019s sake, since my wife made a fair point that her diagnosis is a more pressing concern at present. I did, however, gently remind her that I am open to the possibility I am wrong, and I am willing to have my beliefs unpacked and discussed using Street Epistemology.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI would love to, as an aside, point out how supportive the Street Epistemology Private Study Group on Facebook was for me in this situation. This experience helped convince me that sharing it with the group was the right decision, as the outpouring of response and empathy was refreshing. The comments and feedback I received indicated that I had made a good decision in sharing my experience with the group. To all who took the time to support me and give feedback there: thank you.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIn retrospect, I\u2019ll close in true Street Epistemology style with a series of questions: Did my wife feel hurt to discover I\u0027d been hiding the book? Yes. Was it uncomfortable to defend such a provocative book title as \u003Ci\u003EA Manual for Creating Atheists\u003C/i\u003E? Yes. Was it a beneficial exercise that increased my empathy and understanding, as well as stressed the importance of being forthright, open, honest and genuine? Absolutely. \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EVeridor is a network engineer, a skeptic, and a free-thinker who tries to model doxastic openness and embracing the null hypothesis. He also enjoys engaging in civil discussions that lead to a mutually increased understanding of truth.\u003C/i\u003E\n\n\t\t\u003C/p\u003E"

If you want to be effective at Street Epistemology (SE), I believe you are going to need to know how to address relativism. This blog post will define the issue, include examples to highlight the problem, and offer suggestions to overcome this challenge. You will find little point in discussing someone\u0027s deeply-held belief until you first clear this hurdle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen engaging with people in Street Epistemology-based conversation about their deeply-held beliefs, we usually tend to make a few assumptions. One of the biggest we often make is that our conversation partner thinks the word truth is synonymous with an objective fact \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E they will agree one should strive to believe true things.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnless we specifically test for this, however, we may not discover the disconnect until we are minutes, hours, days, weeks, or even years along in the dialogue. As more people are beginning to converse with each other using Street Epistemology, stories about hitting this mammoth roadblock are surfacing regularly in the various SE discussion communities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhy Should a Street Epistemologist Care?\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are remotely interested in having productive dialogues with individuals using Street Epistemology or some other method, one should be extremely concerned when people think truth is subjective. It\u2019s crucial that we assess how our interlocutor views the concept of truth.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003EIt\u2019s inefficient to engage with a person about their deeply-held belief if they think truth is subjective. One might even say that ensuring a person sees that truth is objective is the Street Epistemologist\u2019s most important task; no additional progress can be made until you overcome this perception.\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003EPeople are motivated to behave in certain ways because of the beliefs they hold. From choosing who to vote for to deciding to launch an attack with unimaginable destruction, the actions we take must be based on objective truth and not subjective realities.\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003ECritical tools in the Street Epistemologist\u2019s arsenal for imparting doubt, like John W. Loftus\u2019 Outsider Test for Faith, for example, are rendered virtually impotent when a person holds a relativistic view of truth, as shown here in this sample exchange:\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJoe: \u201CJesus is real because I feel it in my heart that it\u2019s true.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnthony: \u201CA Hindu woman who believes in Vishnu told me the same thing about feeling it in her heart. How could we tell which of you are correct?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoe: \u201CHere\u2019s the great thing about it. Hindus can believe what they want. That\u2019s their truth! Just like I have my own truth, she has her truth, and you have your truth about God. We\u2019re all right!\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a talk to Chicago Atheist Society about Street Epistemology, I used a glass vase to form a shield around the underlying beliefs (represented by blocks) and gave various examples of things that form that barrier. Asserting that truth is subjective is one of those barriers, and there is absolutely no sense discussing the underlying belief until the obstruction of subjective truth has been addressed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nReference: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/crHkQ93hizE?t=45m54s\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/crHkQ93hizE?t=45m54s\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly, viewing truth as objective is one area where many atheists and hardcore theists tend to agree. So if you\u2019ve been looking for common ground with a God believer, your agreement that truth must be objective could be a great starting point.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003ESubjective and Objective Truth\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore we get too far along, it\u2019s important to address a few definitions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA common definition of \u201Ctruth\u201D that I hear from many prominent atheists (and one that I also happen to accept and use) is \u201Cthat which is concordant with reality.\u201D When I am having chats with people, I prefer to ask people for their definition of the word \u201Ctruth\u201D to understand their usage and as a helpful gauge to see how much thought they\u2019ve applied before to the subject.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that, while I have absolutely no expertise in philosophy, I am attempting to use the best choice of words based on my level of understanding to convey these thoughts in a simple manner. There are a wide variety of wonderful resources online if you wish to delve further into this fascinating topic.\u003Cbr\u003E\nReference: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.iep.utm.edu/objectiv/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.iep.utm.edu/objectiv/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERoughly speaking, something is \u003Cstrong\u003Eobjectively true\u003C/strong\u003E regardless of a person\u2019s opinion, bias, desire, hope, wishes, feelings, or preference.

Or perhaps simply defaulting to \u201Ceveryone is right\u201D is an easy way to avoid the uncomfortable feelings that go hand-in-hand with addressing a belief that might not be entirely accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA key requirement to a successful SE talk is to ensure that your interlocutor not only understands these distinctions, but agrees that their claim is a yes-no, on-off, binary proposition: it is either true or not true for everyone.

I vividly remembered our discussion: a college-aged Christian who said she had both evidence and faith to support her high degree of confidence that Jesus existed. \u0026nbsp;After weeks of waiting to see if she would initiate another talk with me, I cautiously messaged to see how she was doing. After exchanging pleasantries, I asked if she would like to have a follow-up talk, whereupon she said disclosing her current views regarding God publicly might \u201Cbreak my mother\u2019s heart.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe kept messaging each other here and there over the next several weeks, including intense discussion on the various ways we might protect her identity during a follow-up interview. We eventually settled on using an alias email account for communication. Thinking that many people would be skeptical about the exchange, I filmed myself reading our emails as we responded back and forth during a planned one-hour interview, to capture my reaction and perhaps add some legitimacy to the interview if I ever uploaded it (with her permission).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs it turned out, my interlocutor\u2019s \u201Cbig reveal\u201D that she wanted to protect her parents from discovering was her liberal new view that everyone could believe whatever they wanted to and we shouldn\u2019t care if people are believing in things that are true or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter all this precious time between talks, after all the planning to safely meet again, only to uncover relativism. It felt like I squandered an opportunity to really help this person, and I was crushed. How much further down the road of honestly evaluating her God belief would this young woman be if we had first examined her truth valuation? \u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is my hope that sharing this story here (along with my other advice) will help make amends for that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EObtain a Clear Definition Early On\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce you recognize that the subject of truth needs to be addressed, one of the first things is to ask your interlocutor for their definition of the word \u201Ctruth.\u201D Regardless of the amount of time they may have spent thinking about the topic, encourage your partner to really explore the ideas, and if necessary, work with them to understand how they use that word.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBe prepared to revisit the definition provided and see if it holds up to any examples that might be given. Commend people who are willing to tweak their definition of words when if they discover an adjustment is needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf someone is struggling to provide a definition of the word \u201Ctruth,\u201D ask how their usage relates when compared to words like \u201Copinion\u201D and \u201Cfact,\u201D A simple question like \u201CIs your use of the word \u2018truth\u2019 more closely aligned to a personal opinion or a hard fact?\u201D can result in amazing progress.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI was once initially stumped when a person answered my question \u201CWhat is truth?\u201D by saying, \u201CTruth is my Savior Jesus Christ,\u201D without missing a beat. If someone defines \u201Ctruth\u201D as a person or their God, the conversation should probably shift to how they first acquired this view and if only people who believe in a God are capable of believing true things.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can also experiment by using the word \u201Ctrue\u201D instead of \u201Ctruth\u201D when these types of discussions come up. Sometimes simply using the word \u201Ctrue\u201D (and it\u2019s corollary \u201Cuntrue\u201D or \u201Cfalse\u201D) can bypass a lot of confusion and roadblocks that might come up during talks where you are discussing these ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EConduct a \u201CTruth Test\u201D: Armadillos and Tic-Tacs\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u2019ve experimented with two ways to quickly assess your interlocutor\u2019s view of truth during a conversation (and there may be more): first, identify something unrelated to the belief claim (preferably, something your conversation partner has already expressed an interest in) to use as an example, or be prepared to produce a small prop to facilitate a simple thought experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EUse an Unrelated Interest\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first way is to simply pay attention during the rapport-building stage to what your conversation partner is telling you. What line of work are they in? What keeps them busy during the week? Do they have any interesting hobbies? I once met a woman from Poland who was visiting her grandparents in Texas and wanted to see a live armadillo before she left. This led to a lovely chat where we briefly wondered together if the burrowing critters were egg-layers or livebearers. Fortunately, she agreed that it couldn\u2019t be both. When the talk shifted to her God belief and eventually, her view that everyone\u2019s position on the God claim was true, our earlier, innocuous talk about armadillo reproduction made for the perfect example to help distinguish the difference.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EBreak Out the Candy\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother easy way to test for truth is to show your interlocutor a small box of candies or breath mints and ask if they agree that there can \u003Cstrong\u003Eeither\u003C/strong\u003E be an odd or an even number of full pieces of total candy inside the box.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENote: it is baffling how many people will actually respond with \u201CEven!\u201D or \u201COdd!\u201D so take great care in how you form this question!\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nReference: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/Hwod6a2KSZQ\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/Hwod6a2KSZQ\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf a person agrees that the total number of pieces must either be even or odd, they have passed the \u201Ctruth test,\u201D and you can proceed to examining their belief claim. If they say the total number of candies in the container can both simultaneously be even and odd (which does happen with alarming regularity), do NOT move off the subject of truth until you have resolved the disconnect. I once spent 30 minutes with a fellow asking a variety of questions to understand how he could reconcile that my little box of candies was holding an even and an odd total number of pieces. Our talk concluded with him somewhat sheepishly saying, \u201CI\u2019m sorry, but I just can\u2019t seem to give the answer that you might be looking for here.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENote: Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson had a near-legendary discussion on Peterson\u2019s usage of the word \u201Ctruth\u201D and spent the entire second half of their interview to try and clear things up.

If your talk has already delved too deep into the belief in question, some people might intentionally distort their responses to your truth test in order to allow their cherished belief to withstand scrutiny. Don\u2019t worry if you forget or intentionally skip testing their view on truth, because you can always conduct the test later.

It was a real shocker the first time I heard this from someone, so here is a little advice to prepare you for this real possibility.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, make sure that you have accurately assessed how they are viewing the word \u201Ctruth.\u201D Whether you use an unrelated interest like armadillo reproduction as a metaphor for truth or break out a visual example like a box of candy to conduct the \u201Ctruth test,\u201D it should become apparent that your conversation partner can indeed make the distinction between subjective and objective truth. If you are still unclear where a person stands, ask them to perform the same test on you, and answer it directly. Then, repeat the test on them, and see if they respond with a more objective view of truth.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESecond, don\u2019t panic. In my experience, very few people who say they don\u2019t value truth actually believe that. Resist the urge to laugh, act alarmed, or generate some other emotional reaction that might embarrass your conversation partner. More than likely they are saying such things because they haven\u2019t really given it much thought, or perhaps because they have a low self-worth. Don\u2019t give up on them, and keep asking questions to help everyone involved to get to the bottom of things.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the simplest things you can do to see if your interlocutor really values truth or not is to ask if they visit a doctor, brush their teeth, don their seat belt before driving off in their car, or any number of other examples. Here\u2019s a brief example from a recent tweet I made to help illustrate the point:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMatthew: \u0022I don\u0027t care if I am believing in something that is not true.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnthony: \u0022Are you content with your child\u0027s pediatrician holding that same view?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nReference: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/magnabosco/status/902648886027853824\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ehttps://twitter.com/magnabosco/status/902648886027853824\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery so often a person will double down on their low valuation of truth. I was once video chatting with a woman who believed in Jesus because her daughter nearly died when she was born, but prayers in the hospital made everything better. Her epistemology for knowing God was behind this miracle was faith. When I proposed a scenario where the woman could board Airplane A that was inspected by a qualified crew or Airplane B that was not inspected but she could use faith that it would be safe, she surprisingly said that she would board Airplane B. However, when I repeated the scenario, but this time it was her precious daughter that would be boarding the plane, she chose Airplane A.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimply shifting the person being affected from my interlocutor to someone my interlocutor loved helped reach a breakthrough: the woman had a low value of truth when it came to herself, but not the loved ones in her life. The talk could then shift to why a person\u2019s value of truth might be different when the individual in question varied.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to assess someone\u2019s commitment to truth is to simply point to one of their valuables and proclaim that it is now yours because \u201Cit\u2019s true for me.\u201D Very few people are going to allow you to walk away with their cell phone or car keys because you\u2019ve made it true in your mind.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI once used this approach with a young woman on a hiking trail that I had already built a great deal of rapport with to illustrate the point:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnthony: \u201CCould you be holding a belief that makes you happy, but might not be really true?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nClara: \u201CI feel like it\u2019s true to yourself and that\u2019s all that\u2019s really important.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnthony: \u201CDo you really live that way?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nClara: \u201CYeah.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnthony: \u201CDo you?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nClara: \u201CI mean, as long as I feel it\u2019s true.

Sadly, however, there are some people who really don\u2019t care if they are believing in untrue things. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have a great deal of advice for dealing with people like that, except to perhaps move on to someone else, like this person\u2019s spouse, children, or other people in their circle who might be influenced by such thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EWe\u2019re in this Together\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is my hope that this article has demonstrated the importance of identifying where our conversation partners stand on their view of truth, and provided you with the tools needed to conduct the \u201Ctruth test\u201D before examining a person\u2019s deeply-held belief.

If you can make it work on more platforms, there will also be a bigger pool of people who come into contact with SE.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E1. Use video if you\u2019re comfortable with that. Them being able to see you sitting there, listening to them carefully, devoting all your attention to them, is everything. When you\u2019re silent for extended periods of time just listening, it\u2019s important that they know you\u2019re not doing something else on the side. You\u2019re not on your phone, or doing chores, or even listening to music. You\u2019re there for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2. Another way to show you\u2019re actually interested in them is to refrain from more general greetings. Instead of saying: \u201CWhat\u2019s up?\u201D or \u201CHow are you doing?\u201D, try: \u201CHow are you feeling today?\u201D This indicates interest and you\u2019d be surprised how willing people are to share their most personal feelings and views. The fact that they can skip you whenever they want means that people there are very willing to share. Listen to them. Often times you won\u2019t even have to ask them for a claim. It\u2019ll come out naturally.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E3. Experiment with different styles. The great thing about doing SE on websites like this is that it helps you find the style that works best for you. Did you read something on \u003Ca href=\u0022http://streetepistemology.com/\u0022\u003Estreetepistemology.com\u003C/a\u003E that you want to try out? Do you want to put on a silly hat to get people to notice you? Maybe you see yourself more as the serious listener type? Will putting up a sign work? All is fair game on websites like this. Stumbling and making mistakes is okay. That\u2019s how we learn.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E4. Like I mentioned before, Omegle allows you to add interests. Once you add interests the website will then try to connect you to people who also have those interests added. I found that this really helps with connecting to people who are also on there to have conversations instead of other things. When you don\u2019t filter for interests the users you connect to will be completely random and therefore you\u2019ll also connect to more people who are on Omegle to misbehave.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E5. It helps to add specific interests that narrow out the sort of claims you\u2019re hoping to talk about. So I put in specific interests like: \u201Creligion\u201D, \u201Cphilosophy\u201D, \u201Cpsychology\u201D, \u201Cchristianity\u201D, \u201Cislam\u201D, \u201Cbuddhism\u201D, \u201Ckarma\u201D, \u201Cspirituality\u201D, etc. It even helps to have multiple variations of specific interests. For example: christianity, christ, christian. You can even go into specific denominations. Use as many of these interests as you can possibly think of even if they seem like a long shot. I personally keep adding more and more as they come to mind and have worked my way up to about 40 to 50 interests like this. Some of the people you will connect with on these interests will be very knowledgeable so they can also give you a great challenge.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, not many people use these specific interests so some patience is required. Don\u2019t expect to connect to people with these interests every time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E6. When Omegle is unable to connect you to someone with your added interests it will fall back on completely random connections (where people misbehave more). So I suggest adding just a handful of more general interests to help avoid this. These interests will be much more common for people to have, so Omegle will then rarely have to go completely random in order to find somebody for you. I\u2019m personally a metalhead and a movie buff so I added: \u201Cmetal\u201D and \u201Cmovies\u201D. I wouldn\u2019t do more than 3 of those so that when someone is online with one of your specific interests mentioned above, they don\u2019t get lost in the crowd. If you find yourself connecting to these more general interests all the time and never on your specific interests, consider removing them for a while. I get a good mix of people this way and when I\u2019m tired of focusing on SE I can just have a normal conversation to give myself a little break.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E7. Be patient. I have mentioned this before but it deserves special attention. Depending on the time of day and the people online, it may take half an hour to find someone suitable. Don\u2019t let that discourage you. Other times you may connect to the perfect person for you right away.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E8. Make an effort to stay civil. Especially if you intend to use the website frequently. You\u2019ll find that there are people who are regulars and you don\u2019t want them bad mouthing you. Maybe a person you don\u2019t think is interesting at this moment might become interesting to you later on. If they\u2019ve gotten in the habit of skipping you, by then there is really nothing you can do about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E9. Some people might share things about their person that may be beyond your capabilities to deal with. They use websites like this as therapy. I\u2019ve heard multiple stories of abuse. And while these stories are heartbreaking, don\u2019t think you can be their therapist. Always suggest they seek professional care.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E10. If someone is in a bad mental state it may also be worth considering whether it\u2019s ethical to start questioning their world view at that point in time. You may be there to change minds but not all minds are stable enough to be fiddled around with.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E11. People are gonna be shallow and skip you based purely on your appearance. That\u2019s just how it is. Don\u2019t let that get you down. There\u2019s always more people.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E12. Give everyone a chance. As much as people judge you on your appearance, we ourselves make that same mistake sometimes. Some of my best and most meaningful conversations have been with people I least expected it from. A neo-nazi displaying swastikas who instantly greeted me with a nazi salute comes to mind. The conversation I had with him talking about his most personal feelings and struggles and hate was challenging to say the least. No-one had ever really listened to him. He ended up thanking me in tears for opening him up to a more positive view of the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u2019s it. I hope these suggestions help. Now go out there and start practising.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EBio:\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHello, I\u2019m BystanderCrux.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u2019m an introverted, life-long non-theist who uses structured SE mostly online on platforms like Omegle and Discord. SE has allowed me to cultivate a second nature of asking Socratic questions. I have found this to be tremendously useful not only for deconverting other people but also for just having normal everyday conversations and for investigating my own convictions.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E"

It will discuss some basic concepts about how beliefs model reality and how epistemology functions as a factory for forging beliefs from the raw material of evidence.  It should help you gain a clear and solid understanding of where to focus your attention so that you can practice Street Epistemology more easily and effectively.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EBelief Formation\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe exist in reality.  We collect data about reality using our senses.  This data is the evidence we use to understand the nature of reality.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ccenter\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://streetepistemology.com/img/16/belief-factory-01.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/center\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe use our minds to convert evidence into internal, mental descriptions or \u003Ci\u003Emodels\u003C/i\u003E of reality.  The model is our understanding of what reality \u003Ci\u003Eis\u003C/i\u003E and how it works.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ccenter\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://streetepistemology.com/img/17/belief-factory-02.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/center\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample: We perceive a wooden crate in front of us using our eyes and hands to explore its contours.  This information is used to help create or reinforce our belief that the wooden crate is \u003Ci\u003Ebox shaped\u003C/i\u003E. \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EBeliefs About Reality Are Models\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen we talk about our beliefs, we are talking about abstract, internal models of how the real world is and works.

When a model is less accurate in this way, we call it a false belief.  When our model is more accurate, we say that the belief is true.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ccenter\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://streetepistemology.com/img/19/belief-factory-04.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/center\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample: If you believe a box to be \u0022a three-dimensional geometric shape that tapers smoothly from a flat base (frequently, though not necessarily, circular) to a point called the apex or vertex\u0022, then your belief would be false as a model of reality.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EBeliefs Are Not Reality\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeliefs people hold about reality are not \u003Ci\u003Eactually\u003C/i\u003E reality.  Beliefs are simplified abstractions.  The fact that these abstractions have the potential to be inaccurate proves that they are, in fact, two different things.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ccenter\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://streetepistemology.com/img/20/belief-factory-05.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/center\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce people have formed their beliefs, (consciously or unconsciously, intentionally or unintentionally) they often interact with the world as if those beliefs are, in fact, reality.  They behave as if there is no relevant difference. When someone points to something and says, \u0022That is a box\u0022, does that mean the thing really \u003Ci\u003Eis\u003C/i\u003E a box?  Or is it just an arrangement of atoms and molecules that happens to match our mental model of \u0022box-like\u0022 things?  The concept (box) and the thing (the atom stuff) are independent of each other.  We commonly ignore this difference for convenience.  However, if someone has never needed to see the distinction, they may be consciously unaware of it and go through life as if the two are entirely synonymous.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIt can be extremely difficult to practice Street Epistemology when someone struggles with this distinction.  Therefore, it may be useful to ensure that your interlocutor understands the difference up front to save both parties some aggravation.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EBeliefs Inform Our Actions\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough our beliefs about reality are mental abstractions distinct from reality itself, they are the only things we have to work with as we live our lives.  When we make choices about how to act, we base those actions on our understanding of reality \u2013 our beliefs \u2013 our mental model of how reality is and works.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nExample: If someone believes that their god wants them to punish a rape victim with stoning, they may choose to take the action of killing a woman.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EInaccurate Beliefs Can Cause Harm\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople live in societies where their actions inevitably affect other people.  If our beliefs are not true and our beliefs inform our actions, then our beliefs (indirectly) and our actions (directly) have a very real potential to cause harm to ourselves and others.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ccenter\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://streetepistemology.com/img/21/belief-factory-06.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/center\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample:  If someone believes that vaccines cause autism, but in fact they do not, they may choose not to vaccinate their child, thereby putting their child and others in the community at risk of serious illness or death.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EEpistemology\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEpistemology is concerned with the theory of knowledge.  It is the study of the nature of knowledge, justification, and the rationality of belief \u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003E.  A person\u0027s \u0022epistemology\u0022 is the process they use to convert evidence into beliefs.  It is the factory that transforms the raw material of evidence into the final product of belief.  To avoid inaccurate beliefs we need to look upstream of the beliefs themselves because they are not the problem; The problem lies in the process (the epistemology) that \u003Ci\u003Etransformed\u003C/i\u003E the evidence into those beliefs.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EGood v. Bad Epistemologies\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood epistemologies are those that are reliable at producing beliefs that more accurately correspond to reality.  Poor epistemologies are those that fail to do so.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nReligious faith is an example of poor/unreliable epistemology.  It is subjective, vulnerable to personal bias, and typically relied upon in the absence of good critical thinking skills.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nScientific methods are examples of good/reliable epistemology.  They strive to be rigorous, objective, and based entirely on empirical observation and logic.  \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ccenter\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://streetepistemology.com/img/22/belief-factory-07.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/center\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample: Even though two people might collect the same evidence (a child became autistic after being vaccinated) they could arrive at two very different beliefs.  Why?  Because their epistemologies were different.  Their reasoning processes (belief factories) differed enough that they converted the same input into different output.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EStreet Epistemology\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStreet Epistemology is a form of conversation that relies heavily on Socratic questioning \u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E.  It attempts to reveal poor epistemologies and demonstrate better ones while simultaneously employing the necessary social skills to help avoid unproductive emotional responses and encourage empathetic attitudes.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EWhy Street Epistemology Is Better\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we accept that actions based on inaccurate beliefs are undesirable, then we should strive to avoid arriving at inaccurate beliefs.  Unfortunately, if you want to challenge someone\u0027s very deeply held (but probably inaccurate) belief about reality, presenting them with alternative evidence will typically fail.  This is because you haven\u0027t altered their epistemology.  They will simply feed your alternative evidence into their faulty factory and come up with another bad conclusion.  Evidence in support of your own belief will only work if their factory works in the same way as yours.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nStreet Epistemology specifically tries to focus on a person\u0027s epistemology (the factory), not on their beliefs or their evidence.  The goal is to reveal to both participants the thinking process that leads from evidence to conclusion. \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ENever mind the evidence:\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen someone presents evidence that you know is poor, resist the urge to refute it with a competing bit of evidence.  Instead, try to form questions that delve into what your interlocutor is \u003Ci\u003Edoing\u003C/i\u003E with that evidence.  Once they discover the flaw(s) in their reasoning (the defect(s) in their factory), they will change \u003Ci\u003Ehow\u003C/i\u003E they evaluate evidence (repair the defect(s)).  They will have improved their critical thinking skills and be better equipped to skillfully evaluate evidence in the future.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ENever mind the beliefs themselves:\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen they tell you about conclusions they\u0027ve reached that you feel are erroneous, don\u0027t respond with alternative conclusions that make more sense to you; Set those aside.  Instead, keep exploring how they transformed their evidence into those conclusions.  When they themselves discover the flaws in their own logic, this will eventually result in improved critical thinking skills that can be applied to any subject going forward. \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EFocus On the Factory:\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, when you detect a logical fallacy, don\u0027t point out that they\u0027ve fallen victim to a logical fallacy.  Instead ask a question that allows them to discover for themselves the flaw in the logic.  For example, if your interlocutor says:\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n     \u0022My evidence is that my son got autism immediately after being vaccinated.\u0022   \n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could respond with:\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n     \u0022Aha!

While followers of mainstream faiths can be very closed in their beliefs, we don\u0027t necessarily consider them victims, but followers. Those trapped in cults are, however, under constant and intense indoctrination, often from birth, and so we have no hesitation in calling them victims.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne organisation that has many characteristics of a cult is the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses (JWs), also known as the Watchtower Society (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Jehovah%27s_Witnesses#See_also\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EWikipedia\u003C/a\u003E). While JWs are well known for their door-to-door proselytizing, and more recently \u201Ccart witnessing\u201D, the general public knows very little about the inner workings of the Watchtower Society and the level of control it has over its members. The slightest suspicion of a critical word against their organisation can automatically trigger an inner defense mechanism that slams the shutters down on the conversation. This can make engaging in Street Epistemology with Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses a daunting task. Even Dr. Peter Boghossian has stated that JWs are the most difficult challenge for producing glimmers of doxastic openness. So, how can we penetrate far enough to provoke thought without springing the interlocutor\u2019s fight/flight reflex?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EAddressing the challenge\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen engaging in SE with JWs, focus on cordiality and curiosity. In fact, we advise speaking as if completely ignorant of all things related to JW, while presenting a child-like curiosity. This approach is strongly recommended by ex-JW and SE enthusiast Kyle Bouchard. Kyle was indoctrinated into the organisation from birth, but managed to deprogram himself in his mid twenties through a love of science and a critical study of the Bible without church supervision. \u201CI cannot stress enough the importance of playing the fool. JWs are conditioned to distrust anyone who comes across as intelligent or educated, or anyone who might suggest they re-examine their beliefs. They are required to limit their interactions with non-members as much as possible, and while witnessing, will only interact with a \u2018worldly\u2019 person (anyone not in the organisation) if they deem there\u2019s a chance that they can be recruited.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELet\u2019s suppose one of us spots a JW cart on the street. With the same curiosity that prompts me to ask for a magazine, I open a conversation, aiming for 15-20 minutes maximum. I say that I\u0027m not strongly committed to any particular set of beliefs but am interested in finding out how others have done so. I introduce myself and establish where they are on the 0-100 scale, invariably 100. I mention how believers in different faith traditions are also strongly convinced by their particular scriptures and gods. When pressed on this point, the IL may respond that \u2018We don\u2019t judge the beliefs of others\u2019. I may reply, \u2018I\u2019m not suggesting you should judge. I just wondered how you account for so many different convictions. What convinced you to become a Witness?\u2019 Hopefully, their answer contains a reference to living by the (true) principles of the bible or that they believe the Witness (Watchtower) interpretation of scripture is the true one.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EThe light gets brighter\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow I focus on separating their adherence to Watchtower teachings about scripture from scripture itself. These start out inextricably bound in the IL\u2019s mind but the doctrine of the \u2018new light\u2019 can help untangle them. Watchtower uses the terms \u2018new light\u2019 or \u2018the light getting brighter\u2019 to justify revisions or changes to official dogma, and most importantly, failed prophesies, of which there have been many. I prompt the IL to open up regarding \u2018new light\u2019 by asking, \u2018If any new information \u003Cem\u003Ecame to light\u003C/em\u003E regarding a particular teaching, and that teaching was revised, would you be prepared to accept the revision or would you stick to the original teaching?\u2019 I may get an obfuscation, a Yes, or No or, \u2018It depends on the teaching\u2019.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf Yes, I reply: \u2018That\u2019s great. Wouldn\u2019t it be more accurate to move a little further down on the confidence scale in order to accommodate further revisions?\u2019 I find this a difficult point to get across, but press the idea that one can\u2019t hold absolute certainty in the current teachings if those teachings are subject to revision. The specific goal here is to get them to move off 100% certainty in the current teachings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf No, I reply: \u2018So you wouldn\u2019t accept the revision, even if the vast majority of your fellow Witnesses went along with it. Wouldn\u2019t that mean you were distancing yourself from Witness teachings?\u2019, or \u2018Do you feel the people who formulate the teachings have a reliable way of interpreting scripture?\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf \u2018It depends on the teaching\u2019, I may take a chance and pinpoint an example of Watchtower policy based, not explicitly stated in scripture, such as refusing blood transfusions or military service. I go with blood transfusions as it\u0027s a sensitive subject, it makes JWs stand out from other Christian groups, and Watchtower has been quietly revising its stance on transfusions; perhaps with a view to scrapping the prohibition altogether.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESE: \u0027Oh, is it you guys who don\u2019t have blood transfusions?\u2019\u003Cbr\u003E\nIL: \u2018Yes.

I\u0027ve had more success imparting doubt about the human component of revealing \u2018The Truth\u2019 than in questioning the Bible itself. Many accounts by ex-Witnesses say they began to doubt because of teachings they couldn\u2019t reconcile with their own reason or personal understanding of scripture.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m likely to hear in response that the (exclusively male) humans comprising the Governing Body are directed by the Holy Spirit, which can lead to a tangle, but I counter with the Outsider Test for Faith: \u2018There are so many people who claim the Holy Spirit guides them to beliefs that differ from yours. Can\u2019t the guidance of the Spirit be interpreted in different ways?\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EExample 1, Clip 1\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5twWrGdcMj5Y1dIS2R6U3J5Z2s/view?usp=sharing\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5twWrGdcMj5Y1dIS2R6U3J5Z2s/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EExample 1, Clip 2\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5twWrGdcMj5T2I5VEFueDR2bGs/view?usp=sharing\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5twWrGdcMj5T2I5VEFueDR2bGs/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConsider the above excerpts from a conversation between myself and a JW husband and wife team manning a cart in central London. I recorded this before I\u0027d fully thought out this approach, but you can hear that they\u2019re encouraged to focus on the importance of belief revision in the light of new information. In the second clip, Stephen opens up about the \u2018new light\u2019 concept and even volunteers the idea that Watchtower has made revisions in the past due to mistakes in interpretation. As a result, he and his wife seem to accept the idea of dropping to 99% to accommodate changes at the end.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EExample 2, Clip 3\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5twWrGdcMj5djJnS1cyNVFCYVE/view?usp=sharing\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5twWrGdcMj5djJnS1cyNVFCYVE/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is the first conversation I struck up with the intent of using the \u2018new light\u2019 strategy. The interlocutors didn\u0027t volunteer the expression, but I managed to bring the idea of changeable JW teachings to the fore after around five minutes. Though quite evasive, both ladies admitted doctrine had been changed in the past and claimed there was no way they would accept Watchtower lifting the ban on blood transfusions, a hallmark belief. I took the opportunity to press them on discrepancies between their personal understanding of scripture and what is taught by the Organisation. One IL also mentioned how the attitude towards Christmas changed in the 1920s, but we didn\u0027t go into detail.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve linked to further audio samples at the end.

Our goal is to provoke reflection on strongly-held beliefs to plant a seed of doubt.

Yes, I admit it, I\u2019m not original. I\u2019ve become a \u201CThat\u2019s right\u201D-digger only by emulating this great master. But let me add my own experience here. I\u2019ve started to notice a pattern in my conversations. I\u2019ll be asking these \u201CWhy?\u201D questions...my IL will be answering...The IL is \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E not really getting to the root of their chain of justifications, and I\u2019m trying to work down to the true hinge of their belief as fast as possible.

I\u2019ve been here before, haven\u2019t I? I know this; I know what happens here. My social instincts are warning me in advance that whatever I\u2019m about to do, for one reason or another, something\u2019s \u003Cem\u003Ewrong\u003C/em\u003E with it. A few times, I noticed that feeling, I thought for a second about what to do about it. Nothing came to mind, so I shrugged and told myself \u201CHey, it\u2019s a perfectly reasonable question\u201D and soldiered on. \u003Cem\u003ESigh...\u003C/em\u003E\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSurprise! They were put off. I lost a few IL\u2019s this way. Now I do a bit better. I notice that feeling of unease, the \u003Cem\u003Ewarning\u003C/em\u003E, the one that real interrogators, I do not doubt, have to get used to, and I let it guide me away from interrogator danger. Now, when I feel that a \u201CWhy?\u201D question will not be well-received, I deftly swap in a Feedback. I feedback and feedback and feedback until I get a \u201CThat\u2019s right\u201D back.

SE\u2019s grand and \u003Cem\u003Edefining\u003C/em\u003E departure from the Socratic Method is that while everyone wanted to kill Socrates after he used it on them, SE enjoys the \u003Cem\u003EEliza Effect\u003C/em\u003E, inviting people to openness, honesty, and reflection. I\u2019ve often been a little too Socrates and too little Eliza, and, as you could expect, my IL\u2019s have been a little closer to giving me hemlock than their hearts.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the next time your IL shows the signs of being too used to being burned to open up and be honest with you (and with themselves) about their epistemology, remember to get a \u201CThat\u2019s right\u201D out of them. I sometimes remind myself \u201CIF I sense my IL isn\u2019t going to like another challenging question, THEN I will seek a \u2018That\u2019s right\u2019\u201D (see \u003Ca target=\u0022_blank\u0022 href=\u0022http://lesswrong.com/lw/o7c/making_intentions_concrete_triggeraction_planning/\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E for more on this effective way of reminding one\u2019s self to do something at the right time).\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI am Hunter Glenn.

This post will focus specifically on the things one can do in order to give an informative talk on Street Epistemology (SE), based on more than a dozen presentations I\u2019ve given on the subject over the years.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs more and more individuals have started learning about (and have become enchanted with!) SE, requests from people on how to best give a talk about this method to their local groups have increased. I will link to this article when future requests for advice roll in, and I will append more tips as comments below as new suggestions arise.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis article is broken up into three sections: things to consider \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E giving your talk, things to cover \u003Cem\u003Eduring\u003C/em\u003E your talk, and things to do \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E your talk on Street Epistemology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EThings to Consider Before Giving Your Street Epistemology Talk\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETake the time leading up to your talk to address these details in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EAssess Your Audience\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding the composition of your audience is an important consideration. How many people will attend? Will most be familiar or unfamiliar with SE? Can you expect hostile detractors? Having an understanding of who will likely be attending is a good first step before you prepare one slide or talking point.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your audience will be primarily comprised of people who have never heard of SE, extra time will be needed to cover the basics. With a more familiar crowd, you can gloss over the basics and delve into the deeper concepts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs SE becomes more commonplace, the number of people who may take issue with the method will probably increase, so be prepared for people who may want to disrupt your talk and have a plan in place for how to deal with interruptions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003ERespect Your Assigned Duration\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReceive in writing how much time you will have to give your talk and, if possible, to take questions from the audience. Stick to that plan as best you can out of respect for everybody involved.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, be prepared to scale back or expand your talk, just in case the situation changes on the day of your presentation. I like to have an extra video example and a few more slides tucked away just in case, and have had to use these on more than one occasion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that a 20-minute talk with no time for questions will be a much different talk than one where you have 1.5 hours and a generous time at the end to answer audience inquiries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003ERecord and Share\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your hosts will allow it, give serious consideration to recording your talk so that others may enjoy it. Why spend time preparing for a talk on SE to one room of 30 people when you can record and upload it for thousands? It takes a great deal more effort to capture and edit the talk, but well worth it if you can spare the time and have some familiarity with the equipment needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf possible, I suggest that you bring your own recording equipment and have a friend or two help you set things up at least two hours beforehand, instead of relying on your hosts to capture the talk. I\u2019ve literally waited months to get my hands on host-captured footage, only to find that the quality was poor or some other issue prevented me from using it. Do everyone a favor and take equipment that you are familiar with and record everything yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf possible, orient the video camera so the screen displaying your slides and video are NOT in the shot. You can easily add your slides and video examples later during the video editing process, and it will look a lot better than some fuzzy screen. In this setup, stay in one spot and keep the camera trained on you, preferably with a non-distracting background, and your final video will look much better.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother important consideration is the privacy of your audience. Assume that not everyone will be happy to be included in your video, so face the camera so no one will also be recorded. You don\u2019t want to go through all the effort of preparing, giving, recording, editing, and uploading your talk, only to learn that someone who was in the audience wants you to take it down because they\u0027re not out to their family and friends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EConsider Your Safety\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the most part, your audience will probably be very welcoming and excited to hear your talk. But that may not always be the case. Discuss with your organizers in advance how to handle hecklers and the best exit route if you feel like your safety is in jeopardy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EThings to Consider During Your Street Epistemology Talk\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKeep the following suggestions in mind while giving your presentation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EFirst Steps\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the first things I like to do before getting too far into my talking points is to query the audience to see how many people are familiar with SE. Even if you don\u2019t plan to make one change to your talk, asking this question shows an interest in your audience, and could give the impression that you are planning a customized talk just for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso be sure to explain to people early on why SE is important to you. Share something personal with your audience so that they can better understand what motivates you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is also a great opportunity to set some ground rules: let people know they can ask their questions at the end of your talk, or if you prefer a hand raise in the middle of your presentation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003ELay Out Your Plan\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETell the audience very early on what you plan to cover, and the order in which you plan to cover it. For example, \u201CAfter I cover some basics on SE, I\u2019ll show a video, delve into some deeper concepts, and then open it up for the Q\u0026amp;A.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003ERequired Talking Points\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI think there are a few topics that nearly every SE talk should contain:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003EA quick review of the history of the method is essential, including a reference to the Socratic method, Peter Boghossian\u2019s book \u003Cem\u003EA Manual for Creating Atheists\u003C/em\u003E, a definition of the word \u201Cepistemology\u201D, and how people are taking the method into exciting new directions.\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003EClear up the common misconception that one has to initiate talks with strangers in public for it to be considered Street Epistemology. It can\u2019t hurt to mention this a few times during your talk.\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003EExplain that SE is never about telling people what to think, like an evangelizer or proselytizer might do. Rather, SE is about asking questions to understand what a person believes, why they believe it, and how they determined that their methods were reliable.\u003C/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003EWhile you may feel differently about it, I think we have an obligation to be available for people once we\u2019ve had an SE-based discussion with them. Discovering that a core belief you have may be unjustified can be very unsettling, and we should be accessible to guide people to support-related resources if they request it.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EWords Matter\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u2019s interesting how one or two words can distort the entire tenor of your talk. Avoid framing Street Epistemology as \u201C\u003Cstrong\u003Egetting\u003C/strong\u003E people to change\u201D or \u201C\u003Cstrong\u003Emaking\u003C/strong\u003E people see they\u2019re wrong\u201D. Instead, frame your message in terms of helping people correct their possibly mistaken views of reality, because that\u2019s largely the goal here. Better framing examples are \u201C\u003Cstrong\u003Ehelping\u003C/strong\u003E people reflect on their beliefs\u201D or \u201C\u003Cstrong\u003Eassisting\u003C/strong\u003E people with the discovery that they could be mistaken\u201D.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EShow an Example\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the best ways to help your audience get excited about and better understand SE is to show one of your favorite video examples. I would not recommend playing a video for any longer than 10 or 12 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, be sure to \u201Csetup\u201D the video before playing it, so you can prepare your audience for what they are about to see. For example, \u201CIn this video, a guy is standing on a college campus asking people to stop and chat about one of their deeply-held beliefs. A woman agrees to discuss her belief in karma, and the video will start playing after he\u2019s asked her to chat, explained his purpose, and started a timer for five minutes. Pay attention to how many questions he asks, his respectful tone, and how much space she\u2019s given to think things through.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u2019t feel like you have to choose examples where the topic is exclusively about God claims. SE is perfect for other claims like karma, ghosts, social and political issues, horoscopes, etc. In fact, expanding your examples to less controversial topics may help your audience avoid getting too wrapped up in the topic and stay more focused on the technique.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAvoid the temptation to perform a live example in front of the audience. Your volunteer may be nervous, you may be nervous, and the whole thing may leave the crowd with a completely different perception than you want. Instead, direct people to the now hundreds of video examples that are available online today. If they persist, agree to conduct a small chat with someone after your talk has completely concluded and you have had a chance to relax a bit after your talk.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EQuestions and Answer Session\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Q\u0026amp;A portion of your talk is usually the most informative and engaging part for both the presenter and the audience. A little planning here can really help leave attendees with a lasting impression.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether or not your talk is being recorded, or the audience member has a microphone where everyone can easily hear, always summarize and repeat back the question you are being asked. This adds clarity and may help subsequent questions from the audience to be more concise. If someone asks a good question, let them know it by saying, \u201CGreat question!\u201D.

There are no membership dues. No place we congregate. No tests we take. You just need to be committed. Committed to helping people lead more reflective lives. Committed both to listening and to speaking up when you hear under-evidenced views that do not align with reality. But also committed to changing your mind if they do align with reality. So commitment is vital. That doesn\u2019t mean every single interaction, but it does mean it\u2019s something in which one is actively engaged. And one MUST be committed to not taking money if they help someone break through dogmatism. So those are the qualities we need to turn the tide on irrationality.\u0022\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014 Dr. Peter Boghossian, via email on Sun, Jul 10, 2016 at 11:07 PM\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EComing and Going\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a member of this site, you can easily add or remove yourself from the List of 10,000 as necessary.

And I immediately wanted to be a part of it.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nA little googling back then brought me to this very website, where an enterprising man named Leif Cid, completely on his own initiative, was compiling the names of people who emailed him and asked to join. As interest in Street Epistemology increased over the months and years, the number of people asking to join the List of 10,000 also grew, outpacing our ability to keep the site current.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the majority of our discussions about technique and strategy regarding SE take place on the Private Street Epistemology Facebook Group, there was no good way of keeping tracking of people who wanted to join the List, so a small team of volunteers worked to update the functionality of this website to not only offer a portal to all things SE, but to create a more scalable meeting place, including the ability for members to add (and remove) themselves from the List.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile embarking on the re-design, the team realized that it would be nice to not only give people the ability to specify how their name and location appear on the List, but to include some demographics (e.g., city, state, country, belief type, etc.). While this website and its content are not in any way controlled by Boghossian, we do have his support behind managing the List of 10,000. In other words, this is the Official List.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003ERespecting the Early Adopters\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs much as we wanted to build up \n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://streetepistemology.com/the-10000/\u0022\u003EThe List of 10,000\u003C/a\u003E\nin the same order as people requested to join it, the task proved too difficult due to distributed record-keeping. However, we did manage to re-invite those people who emailed us to create a new account on the website and consider joining the List, starting from 2013 to current date.

These options for understanding the method also serve as entry points for people who have never heard of it before. It fascinates me when I hear people report that their first exposure to Street Epistemology (SE) may have been a chat they had with someone in virtual reality or in the comments section of a TikTok video.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMost are pleasantly surprised when they learn there are also books, videos, and robust communities that have formed over the years around this exciting method.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince there are now so many potential entry points into Street Epistemology, it could be a bit confusing for people who have discovered the method, want to learn more about it, but don\u2019t know where to go next. I\u2019m hopeful this blog post will serve as a \u201Croad map\u201D and outline some of the directions one can head in order to start soaking things in.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese are not listed in any particular order. Select what you think works best for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EThe Website\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the first places anyone wanting to learn more about Street Epistemology should be the SE Website. While the site itself is not particularly magnetic, it\u2019s a good place to familiarize yourself with some of the basics of Street Epistemology before launching off into the various SE communities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to finding links to pretty much everything I plan to mention in this blog post, the website addresses many of the basic questions people unfamiliar with Street Epistemology may have. Here you can find answers to frequently-asked questions, watch the featured SE video of the month, read blog posts from people in the SE community, and even find a store that offers SE-themed merchandise.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOriginally fan-managed, the SE Website and domain name are now owned by the non-profit that was created in 2019 called Street Epistemology International.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EThe Books\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStreet Epistemology got its start with a book in 2013 called \u003Cem\u003EA Manual for Creating Atheists\u003C/em\u003E\u0026nbsp;and a much-needed update in 2019 with \u003Cem\u003EHow to Have Impossible Conversations\u003C/em\u003E. Interestingly, both books barely mention \u201CStreet Epistemology,\u201D yet the concepts promoted in both books are foundational to the method.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGiven the choice, I\u2019d suggest reading Boghossian\u2019s most recent book, as it\u2019s broader in scope and includes more specific suggestions on how to apply the technique. It\u2019s not uncommon, however, to meet accomplished practitioners who have never read either book, so don\u2019t beat yourself up if you haven\u2019t had time to investigate those yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI personally think there may be a need for a more comprehensive book on Street Epistemology that covers the genesis, history, application, and potential of the approach. Maybe one day soon I\u2019ll put something together.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EYouTube Channels\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVideos of people practicing Street Epistemology began surfacing around 2014. These discussions provided a stark contrast between the argumentative examples between theists and atheists that dominated the landscape. While in retrospect many of these video examples were fairly crude, recommendations from viewers (often from people with experience in philosophy, psychology, psychotherapy, and linguistics [to name a few]) helped many practitioners improve their interactions.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile videos take more time to consume, they are often an entertaining way to learn Street Epistemology by simply observing a few interactions. If time permits, try to scroll down and read the video comments, where you can really get a sense of how these talks are impacting observers and the practitioners of the approach.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe number of people uploading videos related to Street Epistemology seems to ebb and flow, and I personally cannot get enough of them. Watching examples where someone is using SE with another person to explore their claim can both be entertaining and educational. There\u2019s something incredible about watching a person think about their thoughts that really highlights the potential of the SE approach.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u2019s also quite encouraging to see people outside of the community discussing Street Epistemology\u2014the technique is slowly getting noticed and is drawing lots of attention.

Practitioners tend to have different styles, venue considerations, and even cultural differences that keep things interesting. If you do happen to stumble across a Street Epistemology video, please try to leave constructive feedback for the originator to read, as well as anyone else who may happen by later. I think critical yet supportive feedback is crucial to our growth.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003ETikTok\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u2019s been really exciting to see Street Epistemology taking hold on this particular platform, because lots of people of all ages are on it and the medium itself seems to inspire creativity. The video clips on TikTok are usually 30 seconds or less in duration, often include snippets of popular music, and showcase people saying or doing something interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDespite the \u201Cshort burst\u201D nature of most videos, this platform is great for taking complicated topics\u2014something we often observe when doing Street Epistemology\u2014and making them simple and digestible for viewers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDoing a search from within the TikTok app for the hashtag #streetepistemology will help you find active SE content creators, and is a great way to passively learn the method while being entertained along the way. I am very encouraged with this platform in particular as a way to introduce people to Street Epistemology in entertaining ways.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EDiscord\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDiscord is basically an online forum with a layout similar to a Windows Explorer file system, where instead of folders you have topic-themed channels where other people around the world can text, voice, or video chat.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u2019ve probably heard people talking about this platform, but don\u2019t know much about it. I didn\u2019t either until about a year or so ago. It apparently started off as a place for gamers to gather while playing online games, but the potential of this platform for the Street Epistemology community cannot be overstated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone can create a Discord \u201Cserver\u201D and invite people to it. The largest server dedicated to Street Epistemology (just over 4,000 members at the time of this writing) has channels where people discuss SE, coordinate with teams working on SE-related projects, practice SE through role-play and real conversations, and even share their audio or video of their live interactions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of my favorite channels is #introduce-yourself, where you can read how people from around the world first encountered Street Epistemology and how it has impacted their interactions. Although it takes a while to get comfortable navigating, the SE-themed Discord servers are my number one recommendation for anyone looking to find other people to engage with about this method.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt will be interesting to see if Discord has the ability to scale alongside the increasing popularity of Street Epistemology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EFacebook Groups and Page\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough SE activity on this platform has seemingly waned a bit from it\u2019s highs a year or so ago, it\u2019s still a great place to meet others and share your experiences.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are currently \u003Ca href=\u0022https://streetepistemology.com/community/\u0022\u003Efour main groups and one page\u003C/a\u003E that you should be aware of, each with a slightly different focus to keep things organized:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EStreet Epistemology Study Group\u003C/em\u003E (Private group, 5.4K members): This was the first Facebook group created for people interested in Street Epistemology, and since the method was originally marketed to atheists only, that restriction for membership still applies. Most discussions center around the application of Street Epistemology. Make sure you answer any intake questions before submitting your Join Request.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELearn Street Epistemology\u003C/em\u003E (Private group, 2.1K members): As Street Epistemology expanded to explore other claims, a group similar to the Study Group was created for people wanting to learn more about the method, independent of where you happen to stand on any claim.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EChat With a Street Epistemologist\u003C/em\u003E (Private group, 1.3K members): This is the place for actually practicing Street Epistemology with someone on their claim. Although eclipsed by the aforementioned Discord servers, this is still a good place to go if you\u2019d like to have one of your beliefs respectfully challenged, role-play a conversation you\u2019re thinking about having with someone, or just practice.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECritique Street Epistemology\u003C/em\u003E (Public group, 500 members): A specific group dedicated to discussing criticisms and concerns about the method. Most of this type of discussion has also moved to the SE Discord servers, but you may still see an occasional post here or there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is also a public Facebook Page for Street Epistemology that makes general posts about SE-related events or topics, but it\u2019s not a very interactive place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EReddit\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith just under 10,000 members at the time of this writing, the Street Epistemology subreddit is a great place to keep up with our antics. While I personally don\u2019t frequent this platform all that much, it seems like an underutilized resource that could benefit from some coordinated attention. It would be great to see a lot more SE discussions and \u0026nbsp;activity on this search-engine crawled community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EThe Street Epistemology Podcast\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAudio only examples of Street Epistemology have been uploaded since 2015, and at the time of this writing, had more than 570k plays. The SE Podcast is available on a variety of different podcasting platforms, and is a great way to keep up with Street Epistemology.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe podcast not only airs examples where SE is being used, but blog posts, related shows, interviews with practitioners and members of the SE community, and much more. Each episode is currently played approximately 1,200 times.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have been following the SE Podcast for a while, please consider leaving a review and/or comment for others who stop by to take a listen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EThe Complete Street Epistemology Guide\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA few years ago, a small team of volunteers assembled the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://streetepistemology.com/publications/the_complete_se_guide\u0022\u003ESE Guide\u003C/a\u003E, based on our best understanding of Street Epistemology at the time. While it may be dated in a few areas, this document is still a great way to grasp many of the concepts related to Street Epistemology.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe SE Guide will likely be translated into multiple languages after the resource can be reviewed and updated as a formal project.

A great place to practice and introduce people to SE are the very clubs and communities and groups that you are already a part of. This could be groups formed around knitting, guns, social justice, activism, politics, etc. Imagine the dialectical advantages your group can enjoy if they started to employ the SE toolset in their interactions!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EConclusion\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u2019s a pretty comprehensive list of the resources and communities that are currently available for people who are interested in learning more about Street Epistemology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u2019m hopeful that you will consider interacting with people in these places to develop a better understanding of what we\u2019re trying to build and accomplish with Street Epistemology, and in the process, help us create something even better.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Chr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnthony Magnabosco is a practitioner and promoter of Street Epistemology, and is the current Executive Director of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://streetepistemologyinternational.org/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EStreet Epistemology International\u003C/a\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E"

Looks like somebody over   there is reading the Bible, and I\u0027m going to try to start using my Boghossian Street Epistemology techniques. [I\u0027m a] self-admitted novice here\u2014never really done this before\u2014but I\u0027m going to try my best to start employing the techniques that I\u0027ve learned from reading Peter\u0027s book, and hopefully get better from there.\u0022 \u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:right;\u0022\u003E\u2014December 28, 2013 ( \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/8Ptr8GCT6d0\u0022\u003EVideo\u003C/a\u003E )\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EBackground\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had just finished reading Boghossian\u2019s book, \u003Ci\u003E\u2018A Manual for Creating Atheists\u2019\u003C/i\u003E and was heading out to engage the faithful for the first time when I recorded those words. Aside from a handful of short scenarios in Boghossian\u2019s book and a fledgling group of early adopters sharing their experiences in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.facebook.com/groups/streetepistemology/\u0022\u003EPrivate Street Epistemology Facebook\u003C/a\u003E Group, there were no audio or video examples of people using Street Epistemology (SE) to learn from at the time. Nothing!\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nNot to be deterred, I started engaging with believers using my best understanding of SE. Many of these encounters were filmed and uploaded to my YouTube channel, which is nearing 2 million video views as I write this post. I didn\u2019t realize it until just recently, but the constant feedback I received over the years\u2014from casual viewers, to people well-versed in SE, to Dr. Peter Boghossian himself\u2014were slowly shaping my approach into what you see today. \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ESidenote: Although this was a journey that took me three years to reach, I still feel like there is room for drastic improvement going forward. I\u2019m nowhere close to being done working at this!\u003C/em\u003E\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause I had saturated YouTube with my personal examples, and because there weren\u2019t a whole lot of other alternatives, many people (critics and supporters) walked away with the impression that SE could/should be performed one way: Magnabosco-style.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI \u003Cem\u003Enever\u003C/em\u003E formed a conscious goal to build (what some people have dubbed) a \u201Cscript\u201D to be blindly copied by the masses. My goals were pretty simple, perhaps even selfish: How could I get faster and more effective at SE in order to reduce video durations and help popularize this method for viewers who likely won\u2019t sit through an hour-long video?\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you talk to enough people with the goal of becoming proficient at Street Epistemology, more than likely you, too, will notice that your talks (regardless of your interlocutors\u2019 religious affiliations) may appear to observers to follow some sort of unflinching flowchart.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nToday, I have mixed feelings about the perception that there is a Street Epistemology \u201Cscript.\u201D Let me explain.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EPitching (Promoting) the \u201CScript\u201D\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn one hand, I can see how beneficial having examples must be to someone new to SE; I craved samples to study before creating some myself.  Being better prepared for conversations with a believer, regardless of their claim, can be extremely advantageous and potentially calming for someone new to Street Epistemology.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI also suspect that many people may have never felt comfortable or prepared enough to have a conversation with someone in the first place unless they had familiarized themselves with a few video examples beforehand. Having a rough idea of where a conversation might head in advance could provide people with that extra bit of reassurance needed to inspire them to continue on with the discussion. A discussion that could very well end up benefiting everyone involved.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople regularly contact me to say that when they used SE for their very first time, they helped someone else honestly examine the epistemology of their belief, often with incredible outcomes. A self-reported lowering of confidence in a belief. Abandoning behaviors that were not concordant with reality. A willingness to examine other beliefs they held to the same scrutiny.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThese people usually go on to say that watching SE videos helped prepare them for the discussion. Reports of this alone cause me to think twice about discounting the \u201Cscript.\u201D\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EPitching (Discarding) the \u201CScript\u201D\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest concern I have when people appear to be following the \u201Cscript\u201D during a conversation is the perception\u2014usually from outside observers and not the actual participants\u2014that the person conducting SE is detached and disingenuous. This can be particularly difficult to dispute when a person mimics entire phrases or exclamations of surprise they may have copied from watching elsewhere (e.g., \u201CYou\u2019re 100% confident? Wow!\u201D).\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow can you claim to be open and objective if you are not being sincere and authentic yourself?\u201D is a valid criticism. While it appears helpful to rely on conversations for guidance and confidence, it is imperative that you develop your own style. As Peter Boghossian said \u003Ca href=\u0022https://streetepistemology.com/publications/street_epistemology_is_open_source\u0022\u003Erecently\u003C/a\u003E,\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u201CThese are your conversations. Your friends. And helping people in your life to be more reflective, honest, and less dogmatic about their beliefs demands that you use your voice in those conversations. Not mine. Not someone else\u2019s. Yours.\u201D\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u2019s solid advice. Try your best to bring your own ideas, personality, and experiences to your conversations. Be yourself. Tell a personal story that helps show why these talks matter to you.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u2019s also nothing wrong with admitting that you are using Street Epistemology during your conversations. There\u2019s nothing to hide, because the method is friendly, sincere, respectful, thought-provoking, and potentially change-inducing. Something simple like, \u201CHey, can we shift gears a bit here? I\u2019d like to ask you some questions that I\u2019ve heard from people who are using this thing called \u2018Street Epistemology. What do you think?\u201D \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EGoing Forward\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe conversations one might watch on my YouTube channel today are the result of hundreds that preceded them, and have been shaped by thousands of (solicited and unsolicited!) suggestions from people over the years. It would be short-sighted if we did not try to learn how to get better at SE by studying these examples, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh10RgQgGuM_R-Qe34sq3t2qjdsL2sb_c\u0022\u003Eand the examples of others\u003C/a\u003E closely.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it is also very important that we don\u2019t just stop there.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIncorporate something unique about yourself into each of your talks. Make a note of what was effective and what set your talks back. Practice. And finally, please share your successes and failures with me and the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://streetepistemology.com/the-10000/\u0022\u003Ethousands of other people\u003C/a\u003E  who are learning Street Epistemology so we can all continuously work to improve this important approach that appears to be helping people re-examine their deeply-held beliefs across the world.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\n\t\t\u003C/p\u003E"

For more detail, see the 40-page \u003Ca href=\u0022https://streetepistemology.com/publications/the_complete_se_guide\u0022\u003E\u0022Complete Street Epistemology Guide: How to Talk About Beliefs\u0022\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe term \u0022Street Epistemology\u0022 refers to a conversational technique introduced in 2013 by Dr. Peter. Boghossian, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Portland State University. It is a more productive and positive alternative to debates and arguments. A growing number of people worldwide have found value in the technique and are adopting it in their conversations with others about extraordinary (mostly supernatural and/or religious) claims.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe goal of street epistemology is to guide people into engaging their critical thinking skills and applying them to their own beliefs about the world. Street Epistemology is about teaching the most fundamental features of critical thought. It\u0027s about helping people recognize the value of skepticism and the scientific method. It\u0027s about illuminating the distinction between beliefs about the universe and the objective truth of the universe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowing is a step-by-step description of how a street epistemology encounter typically proceeds. In addition to \u0022street epistemology\u0022 (the technique), the abbreviation \u0022SE\u0022 will stand for \u0022street epistemologist\u0022, or the person practicing SE (you). Your dialogue partner will be referred to as your \u0022interlocutor\u0022 (a fancy word meaning \u0022a person participating in a dialogue\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESE works best in one-on-one conversations where both participants can apply their full attention to what the other is trying to say. Although direct, real-world encounters are most efficient, people are also experimenting actively with other mediums such as video-chat and online text forums with some success.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EStep 1: Build rapport with your interlocutor\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuild rapport with your interlocutor before getting deep into dialogue. Try to find something that you have in common. Taking the time to do this cuts through much of our natural, instinctive, anxiety about immediately engaging with a stranger.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EStep 2: Identify the claim\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may already know what your interlocutor\u0027s claim is. For example, you may have initiated the discussion because you overheard them say that they believe in UFOs. Or, if you are actively looking to practice SE on anyone and any subject, this step may involve idle chit-chat with the hope of chancing upon a worthwhile claim. Most people who practice SE are focused on religious claims, so a common claim is something like, \u0022God is real and the Bible is true\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EStep 3: Confirm the claim\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConfirm that you have understood your interlocutor correctly by summarizing and repeating their claim back to them. Don\u0027t continue until you are both sure that you understand it clearly. If necessary, write down the claim so that you can both refer to it if the conversation goes off track.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, you might ask, \u0022Do I understand correctly that you believe God is a real entity and that the things written in the Bible are truly the word of God?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EStep 4: Clarify definitions\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf there are any words that are ambiguous (or potentially so) this would be a good time to nail them down with your interlocutor. For example, sort out what you will both mean when you use the word \u0022God\u0022 or the word \u0022true\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EClarifying definitions is something that you may have to do multiple times as the talk progresses should it become apparent that you\u0027re using words differently.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EStep 5: Identify a confidence level\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAsk your interlocutor how confident they are that their claim or belief is true. If possible, have them put a number on it. If they are not willing or able to quantify it, accept whatever they give you and note that as their \u0022initial confidence level\u0022. For example, \u0022How confident are you that this God is real on a scale of 0 to 100?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENote: The confidence scale is just a way of judging for yourself how much effect your efforts are having.

I suggest reading the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reasonablefaith.org/belly-flopping\u0022\u003Eoriginal post\u003C/a\u003E before continuing.\u003C/em\u003E\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nHello, Marshall. I spotted your letter to Dr. Craig about a recent encounter you had with an atheist who challenged your beliefs and left you feeling unprepared. Craig\u0027s post has comments disabled, and your experience reminded me of dialogues I\u0027ve had with people who afterwards told me they felt like they too \u0022belly flopped,\u0022 so I\u0027m writing this as an open letter to you and everyone who may have had a similar experience.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe description of your conversation with an atheist at your dinner party sounds similar to a method of talking with believers called Street Epistemology (SE). SE is a way of conversing with people in a way that helps them examine the methods they used to conclude that their beliefs are true. Rather than debating someone, SE focuses on the foundation of people\u2019s beliefs, and not what they believe, which could explain why your attempts at apologetics were ineffective and the talk stuck with you. Based on what you\u2019ve described in your letter, it\u2019s possible that your conversation partner was engaging with you using this method.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nYou wrote that you felt like you were on the defensive during the talk. Once I begin dialogue with a believer to understand why they believe their God exists I try to keep the discussion focused. I discourage changing the subject, for example onto my own beliefs, though I understand one may be tempted to do so when feeling challenged. To be fair, you should still have an opportunity to examine the atheist\u0027s beliefs and claims in a separate discussion or by agreeing to \u0022turn the table\u0022 halfway through your time together. \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI fully understand that these types of conversations can shake people up, Marshall. And your response afterwards is completely normal. People have later told me that they prayed to their God, sought advice from professional believers, or met with others who believe the same thing to build up their confidence again in the belief. Addressing the possibility that a belief is not true can be a difficult thing to do, but I urge you to do more than simply insulating yourself from introspection.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep asking questions, Marshall, from both inside and outside of your faith community. Continue to explore the reasons why you believe in a God. Do the reasons justify a high degree of confidence? Are your reasons similar to what someone who believes in a completely different God might offer? Is your confidence in those reasons testable in some way? If you ever find yourself in a similar situation again, I hope you will gladly participate in the talk, and perhaps even use the same conversational approach in return.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds like your dinner party conversation has started you on an exciting journey of inquiry, Marshall. Please \u003Ca href=\u0022http://anthonymagnabosco.com/\u0022\u003Econtact me\u003C/a\u003E if you would like to continue exploring how you arrived at your beliefs, or ask me how I arrived at my beliefs.

Bush famously exhorted the American public to \u201Cstay the course\u201D no matter how much the situation in the Iraq war began to deteriorate. But where does this leave us when we discover that we\u0027ve been on the wrong course? If the captain of the Titanic had seen the iceberg ahead of time, would he have been wise to stay the course no matter what? \n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nReason offers a superior, more rational alternative: embrace the tentative. It\u2019s quite alright to be wrong! If we leave no room for flexibility in our beliefs and opinions, we also leave no room for growth, increasing knowledge, or re-shaping our views to better comport with reality.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFor some background, I\u2019d like to highlight one of the pivotal moments in my journey away from faith. I was watching a debate over creation vs evolution between Bill Nye and Ken Ham. Toward the end, one of the viewer-submitted questions was \u201Cwhat, if anything, would \u003Ca target=\u0022_blank\u0022 href=\u0022https://youtu.be/z6kgvhG3AkI?t=2h3m59s\u0022\u003E change your mind\u003C/a\u003E?\u201D Ken Ham responded first and simply stated that he was a Christian, and that no one is ever going to convince him that word of god is not true. Bill Nye, however, replied that evidence would change his mind \u2013 that even one fossil in an unexpected layer of the fossil record would change science forever. Though I\u0027d had doubts about the religion of my upbringing since as long I can recall, this was a \u201Clight bulb over the head\u201D moment for me, as it left me wondering why people would be so defiantly steadfast in a belief that is demonstrably and objectively shown to not comport with reality. I was utterly baffled at how someone could be so inflexible in light of seeing new information and evidence. Somehow, our culture sees reevaluation and reconsideration of our positions as anathema when once it was extolled and praised.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is especially apparent in politics recently. We see time after time how the public and the media pundits will excoriate a politician if he or she changes his or her position on the hot-button issue \u003Ci\u003Ede jour\u003C/i\u003E. Both Hillary Clinton and Dick Cheney were in the past opposed to gay marriage, only to later change their personal positions on the issue. As a result, both caught flak for being inconsistent and simply going along with the times. They were accused of being flighty or simply pandering to the LGBT community for votes. It\u0027s no small wonder, then, that much of our politics as of late seems divisive and bereft of compromise. The next time an elected official changes their stance, imagine how refreshing it would be to hear a reporter or voter ask \u201Cwhat led you to change your mind?\u201D\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter discovering a \u003Ca target=\u0022_blank\u0022 href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/magnabosco210 \u0022\u003EStreet Epistemology YouTube channel\u003C/a\u003E, I now know that we need to stop simply offering up counter-evidence to unreasonable positions and claims. Not only must we explore how we arrive at beliefs, but we must model openness and a willingness to revise our positions as needed when presented with new, better information. Show society that it\u0027s quite alright to change your mind. Surely as one changes their commute when confronted with a road closure, we must also throw off the shackles of sacrosanctity we have affixed to deeply-held beliefs. Confidence is acceptable, dogmatic doggedness will do little other than lead us down the road to ruin.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAlong this vein, on the \u003Ca target=\u0022_blank\u0022 href=\u0022https://youtu.be/bBB-egqxH4c?t=45m5s\u0022\u003EFebruary 19th, 2017, episode of the Atheist Experience\u003C/a\u003E, Matt Dillahunty observed the following in a monologue that \u201CFinding out you\u0027re wrong can be painful...

These people are unlikely to respond to Street Epistemology. The appeal of wanting to see if Street Epistemology can affect people like this is understandable, but is it really the best use of our time? Perhaps it\u0027s the thrill of the challenge, a grudge against the tough nut\u0027s particular religion, or perhaps retribution for having believed something similar. But wouldn\u0027t it make more sense to ignore the tough nuts and instead always go for the low-hanging fruit?\u0026nbsp; For example, college students seem to be ideal interlocutors. They are usually legal adults, but not so old that they have become too invested in a single set of beliefs. College is a highly social environment that encourages exploration, challenging ideas, and learning new things - almost ideal for street epistemology. In other words, college students are the exact opposite of the tough nuts.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is another suggestion: When a Street Epistemologist has engaged someone and it becomes clear that the person is not able or willing to entertain hypotheticals such as \u0022If that were to happen, how would it affect your confidence?\u0022, or present their position in plain terms, consider wrapping up the talk and moving on, as the likelihood of making progress is remote.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe know that many of the tough nuts out there are really on a mission of their own: they\u0027re looking to hone their own arguments and see Street Epistemology as a challenge that must be defeated. They\u0027re often looking to boost their followings and are not really interested in engaging in actual dialogue examining their epistemology. There\u0027s nothing wrong with that, but it doesn\u0027t serve the purposes of Street Epistemology. So why help them if it doesn\u0027t help us? \u0026nbsp;Why invest a lot of time and effort for no impact?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short, if our goal is to help people live lives less hindered by weakly-justified beliefs through Street Epistemology, we should be using a strategy that has the greatest effect with the smallest investment of our valuable time. If it is clear that an interlocutor is not engaging in good faith, doesn\u0027t it make sense to spend our time elsewhere?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E"

It is not uncommon for us to attend birthday parties and even end-of-the-year school parties where parents pipe up and ask everyone to join in prayer before eating. Our daughter has even run into trouble with teachers in the past when it became public knowledge that she holds no god belief, so we\u0027ve taught her to keep a low profile. At the same time we want her to be strong and independent. We don\u2019t want her to feel she has to hide who she is or what she believes in, so we\u2019ve stressed to her the importance and value of an understanding of SE. I\u0027ve told her, \u0022You never have to make a knowledge claim with SE, you can simply ask others what they believe and ask why they believe it.\u201D\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to make three points with this blog post and this is the first one: if you have children, teaching them SE is a powerful tool for them to use in situations involving peer pressure, no matter what the subject of the pressure might be. Remind them that they are under no obligation to make any knowledge claim at all, but can simply request compelling evidence to help them make an informed decision. All the pressure then naturally rests on those trying to exert pressure. It\u0027s the ultimate social judo!\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, early in my daughter\u0027s freshman year of high school she was at an after school club with several other students working on a manual task that required very little thinking. While their hands were involved in this mindless duty they were able to get into a discussion. An older boy made a comment about God and my daughter dodged it, so he got more assertive and flat-out asked her if she believed in God or not.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t really care, actually,\u0022 was her response. She later described watching his jaw drop. \u201CI mean, if there\u0027s a good reason to believe, I will. I just haven\u0027t ever heard any compelling reasons.\u201D As she shared the story with me, she told me that he smiled a confident smile like he just KNEW that if he shared his \u201Ctestimony\u201D he would be inviting her to church by the coming weekend.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nShe told me that the conversation continued for the next hour and she recounted it for me as best she could. She admitted to him that she holds no god belief but is open to any evidence. They addressed all the normal \u0022first-tier\u0022 apologetics: Pascal\u0027s Wager, No True Scotsman, and establishing who has the burden of proof. She said it was hard to not get excited because she had heard ALL of these arguments hundreds of times watching \u0022The Atheist Experience\u0022 (both online and live a few times) and was surprised that her Christian classmate had never really thought very deeply about any of this. \u201CWhy is it that atheists think more about this stuff than the people who actually claim to believe it?\u201D she wondered aloud. I held back my desire to speculate that those who thought about it a lot might simply be more likely to become atheists. Instead I said, \u201CPlease continue with your story; I\u0027m eager to hear what happened next.\u201D\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nBut before I share with you what she shared with me, I want to make my second point about teaching SE to children. One of the ways we learn is by watching others do things. Watching the videos and live-streams of others performing SE strengthens our own ability to perform SE. Children today consume far more video than any previous generation simply because of its ready accessibility. If some of that content is SE then they are more likely to be familiar with standard apologetics, common logical fallacies, and good SE practices.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nMy daughter continued the story of her first real SE encounter. \u0022Dad, the best was near the end, when I used the Outsider Test for Faith. I channeled your SE friends and said, \u0027I have a Muslim friend who said the same thing about Allah. How could I determine which is right if both of you use the same method to arrive at your belief?\u0027 Then I just sat there and he really thought about it for a long time. I knew not to start talking too soon, that you\u2019re supposed to let them think about it, even though he looked really uncomfortable. So I just waited for him to say something first.\u201D\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What did he say?\u0022 I asked, probably a bit too enthusiastically. \u0022He said, \u0027I don\u0027t know what to say. I\u0027m really confused. Dude, my hands are shaking,\u0027 and dad, his hands were TREMBLING! But not like he was mad. He just seemed really perplexed. Then he asked me if we could still be friends because he wanted to talk more about this. I was like, \u0027Of course we can still be friends!\u0027 It was really cool.\u201D\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third and final point I want to make about SE in general and SE used by children in particular. People share their religious beliefs because they care. They might be misguided and uninformed, but generally speaking people care. Peer pressure is strong among young people because it is very important at that age to feel as though one belongs. This boy certainly wants to please his parents and his fellow church members, so he is doing what he thinks they want him to do. These tactics often work for the religious because they know that other kids want to belong as well and will often confess a belief in a god just to avoid \u201Crocking the boat.\u201D However our kids don\u0027t have to be ashamed of their lack of belief, nor do they need to shame others for having a belief. It is quite possible to be true to yourself while also maintaining a good friendship.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your child plants a seed of doubt for those with beliefs derived from faulty methodologies, then that\u0027s just icing on the cake.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nUPDATE: Three months after this encounter, my daughter and this boy are still friends, though since then he has never brought up religion in her presence.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\n\t\t\u003C/p\u003E"

He enjoys adventure trips, rock climbing and music. \u003C/em\u003E\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I became interested in SE almost three years ago, I quickly realized how important it is to lead a life based on reasonable epistemology. How can one make proper decisions without a reliable method of determining what is true or false? Therefore, helping others to reevaluate their approach to truth is worthwhile and morally desirable.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough questioning the god belief is one of the most popular applications of SE, it isn\u0027t the only one. There are plenty of other unjustified claims to question: \u0022vaccines cause autism\u0022, \u0022gluten is toxic for humans\u0022, \u00229/11 was an inside job\u0022, \u0022the cure for cancer has already been discovered\u0022 and many more. What links all these claims is a lack of evidence and use of flawed epistemology and modes of justification. After Street Epistemology dialogues, the believer of such claims may reconsider their ways of determining the truth and get closer to reality.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a short discussion I once had with my friend to illustrate the application of SE outside of religion. The discussion took place in Polish, which I have translated to English:\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n[A small party in the garden, my friend sitting with me at the table]\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIL: \u0022I\u0027m chronically poisoned with mercury.\u0022\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nMe: \u0022How do you know that?\u0022\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIL: \u0022I have the symptoms.

My symptoms perfectly fit with those described in mercury poisoning\u0022\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nMe: \u0022Could you tell me about your symptoms? Perhaps you need help.\u0022\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIL: \u0022I feel exhausted and I have a dry skin. And you know, I\u0027ve done a test! Three weeks ago I visited local pharmacy and bought a supplement pill. When I took it, I felt weak, all my muscles were aching and I had diarrhea. The next day I read an article on the Internet that the substance included in the pill has the ability to release mercury deposits from the body, which had caused my symptoms!\u0022\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nMe: \u0022Let\u0027s assume for a while that your pill actually has such properties. How do you know that you have such mercury deposits to be released by this substance?\u0022\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIL: \u0022Well, my symptoms fit with those described for mercury poisoning.\u0022\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nMe: \u0022I understand that you feel weak and have a dry skin.

I\u0027m sure they will help you. If you want to read about mercury poisoning on the Internet I recommend PubMed.com website. There you can find many interesting scientific articles.\u0022\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIL: \u0022Thanks. I didn\u2019t know that webpage. PubMed, yeah?\u0022\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nMe: \u0022Yes.\u0022\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n[Long silence. Other people came in and the topic wasn\u0027t brought up again]\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe claim concerned mercury poisoning of my interlocutor. My first step was to examine whether it was justified to make such a claim. It\u0027s a good advice to visit a clinic when having symptoms, but I couldn\u0027t propose it too early \u2013 it would invoke a defensive posture of being neglected and misunderstood. When asked for evidence of their claim, my interlocutor revealed confirmation bias and flawed epistemology. And this was the place where SE came in. Through asking questions, my interlocutor recognized that their reasoning was flawed. I then recommended visiting a clinic and reading some peer-reviewed papers (since my interlocutor studied biology), instead of anecdotes and opinion pieces on the Internet.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can introduce SE on many topics but be aware that it can be more difficult than on religious claims. In dialogue about god beliefs, we are much better prepared since we know this subject and interlocutors of many religions use similar justifications that come up frequently. On other topics we may not be experts and may even feel out of our depth on hearing something like \u0022Gluten is toxic for humans, and I\u0027ll describe for you how it influences enterocytes in human digestive tract!\u0022 What can we do in these situations?\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, we can avoid assuming that the interlocutor is wrong. The fact that their claim seems extraordinary doesn\u0027t mean it is false, only that it calls for strong evidence. Secondly, we can still assess the process that led the interlocutor to their conclusion, without being an expert on the subject. If their epistemology is flawed, I try to show this in a friendly way and help my interlocutor change it. If I can\u0027t find a flaw due to unfamiliarity with the field, there\u0027s no shame in saying \u0022I don\u0027t know much about that subject, but I\u0027ll read up on it for next time.\u0022  If the interlocutor does present reliable epistemology and their evidence checks out, we can still benefit by changing our mind and learning something new.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing prevents you from applying SE to beliefs other than god beliefs. Make sure you understand your interlocutor, ask for evidence and assess the reliability of a claim and help your interlocutor change their flawed epistemology. Don\u0027t deny the claim just because it is extraordinary, and remember that sometimes you can also learn something new. Keep discussing! These discussions can be rewarding for you and your interlocutors.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022So long as men are not trained to withhold judgment in the absence of evidence, they will be led astray by cocksure prophets, and it is likely that their leaders will be either ignorant fanatics or dishonest charlatans. To endure uncertainty is difficult, but so are most of the other virtues.\u0022 - Bertrand Russell\u003C/em\u003E\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\n\t\t\u003C/p\u003E"

My answer has evolved a bit over hundreds of talks with believers. Today, if I think the person I am speaking with seems unusually dependent on a belief, I\u0027ll simply ask them if they want to believe true things.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf a person confirms that they want to hold true beliefs and discard false beliefs, I will usually continue with the discussion. Of course, the concept of \u0022truth\u0022 can wildly vary from person to person, but that\u0027s a topic for another blog post. That said, if someone seems unsure as to whether they value truth, stay on the topic of truth until the reasons for their hesitation have been fully explored.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSome think older people should just be left alone when it comes to their beliefs. That reeks of ageism and disrespect to me.  Would I have a conversation with a 77-year-old who believes in Christ because it was drilled into him as a kid? \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/at8eRsORiRM\u0022\u003EAbsolutely\u003C/a\u003E. How about an elderly woman who believes her dead husband was communicating with her when a butterfly landed on her shoulder? \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/M1X2AuYJ8Xc\u0022\u003ESure\u003C/a\u003E. What if a middle-aged woman who believes she has the uncanny ability to tell when people will die or not? \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/zx0MUjaEOLs\u0022\u003EDefinitely\u003C/a\u003E.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe decision to start or continue a talk with a willing participant is ultimately your choice. There are no hard and fast rules here, with one exception: first, do no harm. For example, I once ended a talk with a person who believed a Pagan goddess protected her because there was something about her demeanor that suggested she was unusually dependent on this belief. My decision quickly proved to be mistaken: the same woman emailed me 30 minutes later, expressed gratitude for the talk, and asked to keep the discussion going, which \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh10RgQgGuM_U37md4h9f2jglPZLt0oU1\u0022\u003Ewe did\u003C/a\u003E.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOther times the decision to end a talk is clear: the person is mentally impaired by substance abuse, they have a serious illness and expect to die soon, they start to get upset and begin to threaten you, they stand by their proclamations of harming themselves or others if they no longer held the belief, or they are so closed off and defensive that it is nearly impossible to make any headway.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should also probably avoid engaging in Street Epistemology on sensitive beliefs in situations where there is a power dynamic. For example, doctor and patient, professor and student, employer and employee, house owner and housekeeper, vendor and client. While a person \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E leverage their authority, I am personally uncomfortable using SE in situations where there is even the slightest \u003Cem\u003Eperception\u003C/em\u003E I might be taking advantage of a social dynamic that confers authority. Street Epistemology works best when people on equal footing collaborate to explore a deeply-held belief.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about using Street Epistemology with kids? For example, say you are babysitting your 7-year-old niece and she asks you about Noah\u0027s Ark. Instead of directly examining her claim, I might engage her with a related but fun scenario where she could practice her critical thinking skills, for example \u0022I wonder if all the stuffed animals you own would fit on top of this table. What do you think?\u0022 Saving your epistemological conversations for later with her parents may yield long-term results for the entire family. I also suggest teaching your own kids how to use SE so they can do the work for you. Imagine sitting in your recliner while listening to your child engage their friend in some good-natured SE about monsters!\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother time to bail out of a conversation is when someone insists that you participate in one. A woman once insisted I interview her after concluding a talk with her friend, adding that her post-suicidal self-worth would be affected if I declined. It took several attempts to politely excuse myself before she finally conceded. Just as you should never force anyone to have a chat with you, don\u0027t let anyone manipulate you into speaking with them. The take-away here: only engage in SE if both parties have consented to participate in the conversation.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nA middle-aged man once told me that he would go on a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/CVzV-b_8jGs\u0022\u003Eshooting spree\u003C/a\u003E if he no longer believed his good deeds were being tracked in some kind of metaphysical database. If I were new to Street Epistemology, I probably would have ended the talk and moved on. However, based on his earlier empathetic statements, he did not seem to be a real threat. We pushed past what was likely a defensive mechanism to protect his cherished belief, and afterwards I was delighted that we did. Use your best judgment here: if someone does make a credible threat of violence, end the talk and seek safety. Fortunately, most people are willing to honestly evaluate their beliefs. Even people who initially state that they would harm others if they no longer held a belief might only be saying so because they\u2019ve heard others in their group say it.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nExercise your judgement on when to begin a talk, when to end a talk, and when to resume a talk. What might constitute a boundary for you might be acceptable for someone else. In doing so, consider the interlocutor\u0027s commitment to truth, their physical and emotional states, their willingness to partake in the conversation with you, and your availability to be there afterwards to provide any needed support.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/magnabosco\u0022\u003EAnthony Magnabosco\u003C/a\u003E is an agnostic atheist and frequent practitioner of Street Epistemology.\n\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\n\t\t\u003C/p\u003E"
