We kept in touch since the event, vowing to work together in some capacity. When Rebecca showed me her short ten-page SE-inspired comic, I instantly wanted to help her reach a larger audience by converting it to video. This project challenged my video editing skills like no other, and for that I am grateful. I’m really happy how this project turned out, hope her creative work inspires more people to look into SE, and am eager to work with Rebecca again soon.</p>\n\n<p>Hey, I’m <strong>Rebecca Fox</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>About ten years ago I went through a pretty intense period of questioning and reevaluating my beliefs about the world.</p>\n\n<p>I didn’t mean to demolish and reconstruct my whole world view, I just wanted to look into this idea my colleague had about fluoride in the Australian water supply. But once I started looking into that idea I found other people who were curious about what was true, they called themselves skeptics and they had a seemingly reliable method for assessing claims about fluoride and everything else.</p>\n\n<p>The method has three main aspects: attention to logical coherence, awareness of human biases and respect for reality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Once I embraced these principles they took on a life of their own, whether I liked it or not (and I often didn’t) I found myself applying them to my everyday choices to my ethical positions and to my religion. I started with something easy, a kooky idea my obnoxious colleague was always going on about, and ended up changing my beliefs and my life.</p>\n\n<p>When I first read about Street Epistemology I thought ‘<em>that’s what I do!</em>’. I ask myself the questions that street epistemologists ask other people: Why do you believe that? How confident are you in that belief? What if compelling counter-evidence presented itself? Are you sure?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>‘Are you sure?’</em></p>\n\n<p>I also thought <em>‘I can’t do that’</em>. I’m not the sort of person who can talk to strangers about beliefs, conversations about the weather are stressful enough.</p>\n\n<p>But I know how valuable being encouraged to interrogate your own epistemology is, and having read widely in the field of behaviour change I appreciate how remarkable Street Epistemology is. I wanted to contribute to a movement that I think has huge potential to change individuals lives and society as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>Movements need metaphors, movements need art. Especially movements based on abstract concepts that demand meta-cognition and depend on complex philosophical terminology. Art makes complicated ideas graspable and, art is something I can kinda do.</p>\n\n<p>Epistemology is a tricky word, if we can explain it simply as talking or thinking about our tower of beliefs, it’ll still be difficult to do but I’m hoping we’ll be more inclined to try.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>How to Change Minds</h2>\n\n<p>The following is the actual narration that appears in the ‘How to Change Minds’ comic and video. You can find the artwork and purchase a <a href=\"http://rebeccaonpaper.com/how-to-change-minds-pin/how-to-change-minds-enamel-pin\" target=\"_blank\">wonderful pin (shown here)</a> on <a href=\"http://rebeccaonpaper.com/how-to-change-minds\" target=\"_blank\">Rebecca’s website</a>.</p>\n\n<p></p><center>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rebeccaonpaper.com/how-to-change-minds-pin/how-to-change-minds-enamel-pin\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://StreetEpistemology.com/img/84/pin.jpg\"></a>&nbsp;</center><p></p>\n\n<p>Page 1.</p>\n\n<p>We all walk around with towers of beliefs stacked in our heads.</p>\n\n<p>Though we are not always conscious of them, we are always guarding them.</p>\n\n<p>Negotiating carefully so as not to upset the balance.</p>\n\n<p>Page 2.</p>\n\n<p>Some people’s towers are so tall and precarious that they are too scared to move.</p>\n\n<p>Some people are so good at balancing it seems to defy physics.</p>\n\n<p>Some people are reckless, constantly losing blocks and picking up new ones.</p>\n\n<p>Some people’s towers are short and sturdy, they can dance without fear of falling.</p>\n\n<p>Some people’s towers are so high they can’t enter certain rooms...</p>\n\n<p>… And others have towers just tall enough to ride the ride that they want to ride.</p>\n\n<p>Page 3.</p>\n\n<p>Protecting our tower are two characters.</p>\n\n<p>The Prince and The Beast.</p>\n\n<p>The Prince might be a scientist, a philosopher or a politician.</p>\n\n<p>They could be of any, or no, gender.</p>\n\n<p>(Mine kinda looks like Patrick Bateman.)</p>\n\n<p>The Beast is always ugly and scared.</p>\n\n<p>Page 4.</p>\n\n<p>The Prince and the Beast can’t see the tower, they just know they have to protect it.</p>\n\n<p>The Prince does this with wit and eloquence…</p>\n\n<p>… He is, after all, quite charming...</p>\n\n<p>...And a master of misdirection…</p>\n\n<p>… if someone gets too close to the tower he’ll distract them with a joke.</p>\n\n<p>When cornered he might even give up a few top blocks…</p>\n\n<p>.. to preserve the overall structure.</p>\n\n<p>Page 5.</p>\n\n<p>But if anyone goes for those bottom blocks, the foundational beliefs, they meet the beast.</p>\n\n<p>(low growl)</p>\n\n<p>The beast will not let you take those blocks.</p>\n\n<p>He will fight and bite and claw for them.</p>\n\n<p>Like all violence and anger his is motivated by fear.</p>\n\n<p>He knows how much is invested in the bottom blocks. Perhaps it’s someone's livelihood, or their connection to the people they love, or their entire identity.</p>\n\n<p>He knows what will happen if the tower falls.</p>\n\n<p>The Beast is not stupid, he knows how people work, and how to hurt them.</p>\n\n<p>Page 6.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to try and change anyone's beliefs you have to contend with their Prince and their Beast.</p>\n\n<p>Looking for loose blocks.</p>\n\n<p>Probing to see if they’ll come out easy.</p>\n\n<p>If there’s a millimeter of wiggle room.</p>\n\n<p>While, if you’re lucky, the prince tries to disarm you…</p>\n\n<p>Or, if you’re unlucky, the beast attacks.</p>\n\n<p>(aggressive growl/attack noise)</p>\n\n<p>In some people the Prince is dominant, in others the Beast rules.</p>\n\n<p>They may be sleazy and scary, but their intentions are noble. They think that by protecting the tower they are keeping their host safe.</p>\n\n<p>Page 7.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe, if you’re quick, you can reach in and pull out a few loose blocks. The person might even thank you for lightening the load.</p>\n\n<p>But maybe you get gouged by the beast.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Or you choose the wrong block, and instead of helping them carefully deconstruct it the whole tower tumbles haphazardly…</p>\n\n<p>… and in the chaos someone gets hurt.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, rooting around inside someone's head while they’re not looking seems kinda rude.</p>\n\n<p>Page 8.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why the best way to change other people’s beliefs, or to change your own.</p>\n\n<p>Is not by gingerly prising blocks out one at a time.</p>\n\n<p>It’s by acknowledging that the tower exists.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nOh.</p>\n\n<p>And by asking…</p>\n\n<p>How did you build that?</p>\n\n<p>Why did you build that?</p>\n\n<p>What’s keeping that up?</p>\n\n<p>The Prince and the Beast aren't on guard for questions like that.</p>\n\n<p>Page 9.</p>\n\n<p>So while they’re on a coffee break...</p>\n\n<p>You get to talk to the person themselves, make a genuine connection.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of debating the merits of specific beliefs, you can consider how you decided which blocks to build your towers with.</p>\n\n<p>The higher-up blocks might have been chosen because they made us feel good, or just happened to be lying around.</p>\n\n<p>You may find that most of us didn’t choose our bottom blocks at all. Those foundational beliefs were laid by our culture, our society, or our parents.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Once we know why the blocks are there, we can step back and take a long hard look at our tower…&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Page 10.</p>\n\n<p>… and consider, wouldn’t it be a lot easier to get by with a shorter one...</p>\n\n<p>… Made of beliefs we consciously chose because we had solid evidence to support them…</p>\n\n<p>… you know, something you can dance in?</p>\n\n<p>Talking—and thinking—about the tower is what philosophers call epistemology and if you want to change your own or someone else’s mind it’s the best game in town…</p>\n\n<p>...Because it allows us to talk about beliefs in a way that is kind, supportive…</p>\n\n<p>... and less likely to end in rubble.</p>\n\n<h2>Credits</h2>\n\n<p>To find out how to talk about the tower go to <a href=\"https://streetepistemology.com\">StreetEpistemology.com</a><br>\nTo find more of Rebecca’s work visit <a href=\"https://RebeccaOnPaper.com\" target=\"_blank\">RebeccaOnPaper.com</a><br>\n&nbsp;</p>",

If you want to be effective at Street Epistemology (SE), I believe you are going to need to know how to address relativism. This blog post will define the issue, include examples to highlight the problem, and offer suggestions to overcome this challenge. You will find little point in discussing someone's deeply-held belief until you first clear this hurdle.</p>\n\n<p>When engaging with people in Street Epistemology-based conversation about their deeply-held beliefs, we usually tend to make a few assumptions. One of the biggest we often make is that our conversation partner thinks the word truth is synonymous with an objective fact <em>and</em> they will agree one should strive to believe true things.</p>\n\n<p>Unless we specifically test for this, however, we may not discover the disconnect until we are minutes, hours, days, weeks, or even years along in the dialogue. As more people are beginning to converse with each other using Street Epistemology, stories about hitting this mammoth roadblock are surfacing regularly in the various SE discussion communities.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Should a Street Epistemologist Care?</h2>\n\n<p>If you are remotely interested in having productive dialogues with individuals using Street Epistemology or some other method, one should be extremely concerned when people think truth is subjective. It’s crucial that we assess how our interlocutor views the concept of truth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>It’s inefficient to engage with a person about their deeply-held belief if they think truth is subjective. One might even say that ensuring a person sees that truth is objective is the Street Epistemologist’s most important task; no additional progress can be made until you overcome this perception.</li>\n\t<li>People are motivated to behave in certain ways because of the beliefs they hold. From choosing who to vote for to deciding to launch an attack with unimaginable destruction, the actions we take must be based on objective truth and not subjective realities.</li>\n\t<li>Critical tools in the Street Epistemologist’s arsenal for imparting doubt, like John W. Loftus’ Outsider Test for Faith, for example, are rendered virtually impotent when a person holds a relativistic view of truth, as shown here in this sample exchange:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Joe: “Jesus is real because I feel it in my heart that it’s true.”<br>\nAnthony: “A Hindu woman who believes in Vishnu told me the same thing about feeling it in her heart. How could we tell which of you are correct?”<br>\nJoe: “Here’s the great thing about it. Hindus can believe what they want. That’s their truth! Just like I have my own truth, she has her truth, and you have your truth about God. We’re all right!”</p>\n\n<p>In a talk to Chicago Atheist Society about Street Epistemology, I used a glass vase to form a shield around the underlying beliefs (represented by blocks) and gave various examples of things that form that barrier. Asserting that truth is subjective is one of those barriers, and there is absolutely no sense discussing the underlying belief until the obstruction of subjective truth has been addressed.<br>\nReference: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/crHkQ93hizE?t=45m54s\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/crHkQ93hizE?t=45m54s</a></p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, viewing truth as objective is one area where many atheists and hardcore theists tend to agree. So if you’ve been looking for common ground with a God believer, your agreement that truth must be objective could be a great starting point.</p>\n\n<h2>Subjective and Objective Truth</h2>\n\n<p>Before we get too far along, it’s important to address a few definitions.</p>\n\n<p>A common definition of “truth” that I hear from many prominent atheists (and one that I also happen to accept and use) is “that which is concordant with reality.” When I am having chats with people, I prefer to ask people for their definition of the word “truth” to understand their usage and as a helpful gauge to see how much thought they’ve applied before to the subject.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that, while I have absolutely no expertise in philosophy, I am attempting to use the best choice of words based on my level of understanding to convey these thoughts in a simple manner. There are a wide variety of wonderful resources online if you wish to delve further into this fascinating topic.<br>\nReference: <a href=\"http://www.iep.utm.edu/objectiv/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.iep.utm.edu/objectiv/</a></p>\n\n<p>Roughly speaking, something is <strong>objectively true</strong> regardless of a person’s opinion, bias, desire, hope, wishes, feelings, or preference. An objective truth is the same for everyone regardless of their physical location, age, time zone, prejudices, culture, upbringing or experiences.</p>\n\n<p>Something is <strong>subjectively true</strong> when&nbsp;one bases their conclusions on personal preferences and experiences via their human senses. A subjective truth is relative, can vary from person to person, is nearly indistinguishable from opinion, and is heavily influenced by society, education, biases, desires, emotions, and other factors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Encountering people who hold this relativistic outlook seems increasingly common in my experience, and may be fueled by a strong desire to appear tolerant of other people’s views. Or perhaps simply defaulting to “everyone is right” is an easy way to avoid the uncomfortable feelings that go hand-in-hand with addressing a belief that might not be entirely accurate.</p>\n\n<p>A key requirement to a successful SE talk is to ensure that your interlocutor not only understands these distinctions, but agrees that their claim is a yes-no, on-off, binary proposition: it is either true or not true for everyone. There is little sense continuing to discuss a person’s deeply-held belief if they think their belief can be true for them, but not true for other people.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t forget that many people have never really given serious thought to these ideas, let alone are even remotely familiar with these words, so be prepared to give a respectful introduction to these ideas without coming across as condescending.</p>\n\n<h2>A Disappointing Example</h2>\n\n<p>Several months ago I noticed an interlocutor I had chatted with nearly two years ago started following me on social media. I vividly remembered our discussion: a college-aged Christian who said she had both evidence and faith to support her high degree of confidence that Jesus existed. &nbsp;After weeks of waiting to see if she would initiate another talk with me, I cautiously messaged to see how she was doing. After exchanging pleasantries, I asked if she would like to have a follow-up talk, whereupon she said disclosing her current views regarding God publicly might “break my mother’s heart.”</p>\n\n<p>We kept messaging each other here and there over the next several weeks, including intense discussion on the various ways we might protect her identity during a follow-up interview. We eventually settled on using an alias email account for communication. Thinking that many people would be skeptical about the exchange, I filmed myself reading our emails as we responded back and forth during a planned one-hour interview, to capture my reaction and perhaps add some legitimacy to the interview if I ever uploaded it (with her permission).</p>\n\n<p>As it turned out, my interlocutor’s “big reveal” that she wanted to protect her parents from discovering was her liberal new view that everyone could believe whatever they wanted to and we shouldn’t care if people are believing in things that are true or not.</p>\n\n<p>After all this precious time between talks, after all the planning to safely meet again, only to uncover relativism. It felt like I squandered an opportunity to really help this person, and I was crushed. How much further down the road of honestly evaluating her God belief would this young woman be if we had first examined her truth valuation? &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is my hope that sharing this story here (along with my other advice) will help make amends for that.</p>\n\n<h2>Obtain a Clear Definition Early On</h2>\n\n<p>Once you recognize that the subject of truth needs to be addressed, one of the first things is to ask your interlocutor for their definition of the word “truth.” Regardless of the amount of time they may have spent thinking about the topic, encourage your partner to really explore the ideas, and if necessary, work with them to understand how they use that word.</p>\n\n<p>Be prepared to revisit the definition provided and see if it holds up to any examples that might be given. Commend people who are willing to tweak their definition of words when if they discover an adjustment is needed.</p>\n\n<p>If someone is struggling to provide a definition of the word “truth,” ask how their usage relates when compared to words like “opinion” and “fact,” A simple question like “Is your use of the word ‘truth’ more closely aligned to a personal opinion or a hard fact?” can result in amazing progress.</p>\n\n<p>I was once initially stumped when a person answered my question “What is truth?” by saying, “Truth is my Savior Jesus Christ,” without missing a beat. If someone defines “truth” as a person or their God, the conversation should probably shift to how they first acquired this view and if only people who believe in a God are capable of believing true things.</p>\n\n<p>You can also experiment by using the word “true” instead of “truth” when these types of discussions come up. Sometimes simply using the word “true” (and it’s corollary “untrue” or “false”) can bypass a lot of confusion and roadblocks that might come up during talks where you are discussing these ideas.</p>\n\n<h2>Conduct a “Truth Test”: Armadillos and Tic-Tacs</h2>\n\n<p>I’ve experimented with two ways to quickly assess your interlocutor’s view of truth during a conversation (and there may be more): first, identify something unrelated to the belief claim (preferably, something your conversation partner has already expressed an interest in) to use as an example, or be prepared to produce a small prop to facilitate a simple thought experiment.</p>\n\n<h3>Use an Unrelated Interest</h3>\n\n<p>The first way is to simply pay attention during the rapport-building stage to what your conversation partner is telling you. What line of work are they in? What keeps them busy during the week? Do they have any interesting hobbies? I once met a woman from Poland who was visiting her grandparents in Texas and wanted to see a live armadillo before she left. This led to a lovely chat where we briefly wondered together if the burrowing critters were egg-layers or livebearers. Fortunately, she agreed that it couldn’t be both. When the talk shifted to her God belief and eventually, her view that everyone’s position on the God claim was true, our earlier, innocuous talk about armadillo reproduction made for the perfect example to help distinguish the difference.</p>\n\n<h3>Break Out the Candy</h3>\n\n<p>Another easy way to test for truth is to show your interlocutor a small box of candies or breath mints and ask if they agree that there can <strong>either</strong> be an odd or an even number of full pieces of total candy inside the box.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: it is baffling how many people will actually respond with “Even!” or “Odd!” so take great care in how you form this question!</em><br>\nReference: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Hwod6a2KSZQ\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/Hwod6a2KSZQ</a></p>\n\n<p>If a person agrees that the total number of pieces must either be even or odd, they have passed the “truth test,” and you can proceed to examining their belief claim. If they say the total number of candies in the container can both simultaneously be even and odd (which does happen with alarming regularity), do NOT move off the subject of truth until you have resolved the disconnect. I once spent 30 minutes with a fellow asking a variety of questions to understand how he could reconcile that my little box of candies was holding an even and an odd total number of pieces. Our talk concluded with him somewhat sheepishly saying, “I’m sorry, but I just can’t seem to give the answer that you might be looking for here.”</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson had a near-legendary discussion on Peterson’s usage of the word “truth” and spent the entire second half of their interview to try and clear things up. Harris took on a great deal of flack from listeners for his refusal to move past the confusion, but he was right to not concede: how can you discuss anything with anyone to any meaningful degree if you do not fully comprehend their use of this word?! In my experience, Harris absolutely made the right choice here.</em><br>\nReference: <a href=\"https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/speaking-of-truth-with-jordan-b.-peterson\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/speaking-of-truth-with-jordan-b.-peterson</a></p>\n\n<p>Ideally, the earlier you can conduct your “truth test” in a conversation, the better. If your talk has already delved too deep into the belief in question, some people might intentionally distort their responses to your truth test in order to allow their cherished belief to withstand scrutiny. Don’t worry if you forget or intentionally skip testing their view on truth, because you can always conduct the test later. Just be aware that people may be more disingenuous with their answers to the “truth test” in order to prevent their belief from being compromised.</p>\n\n<h2>Common Phrases to Watch For</h2>\n\n<p>Whether you prefer to conduct a test to assess a person’s perception of truth using one of the examples provided earlier, or you wish to wait until the topic comes up naturally, there are phrases to listen for that could be an indication that your conversation partner views truth as a subjective opinion.</p>\n\n<p>“Anyone can believe anything and make it true…”<br>\n“Everyone’s entitled to believe what they want…”<br>\n“For me…”<br>\n“If it makes someone happy…”<br>\n“If it’s true for them…”<br>\n“It doesn’t matter if it’s true or not…”<br>\n“It’s my truth…”<br>\n“That’s their truth…”<br>\n“That’s your truth…”<br>\n“They can believe whatever they want…”<br>\n“Truth is what you make it…”<br>\n“Who am I to determine what’s true…”</p>\n\n<p><br>\nThis is by no means a comprehensive list, but should begin to give you an idea of what to listen for.</p>\n\n<h2><br>\nWhat if Your Interlocutor Doesn’t Value Truth?</h2>\n\n<p>Street Epistemologists need to be prepared for people who may say that they don’t care if they are believing in something that is true or not. It was a real shocker the first time I heard this from someone, so here is a little advice to prepare you for this real possibility.</p>\n\n<p>First, make sure that you have accurately assessed how they are viewing the word “truth.” Whether you use an unrelated interest like armadillo reproduction as a metaphor for truth or break out a visual example like a box of candy to conduct the “truth test,” it should become apparent that your conversation partner can indeed make the distinction between subjective and objective truth. If you are still unclear where a person stands, ask them to perform the same test on you, and answer it directly. Then, repeat the test on them, and see if they respond with a more objective view of truth.</p>\n\n<p>Second, don’t panic. In my experience, very few people who say they don’t value truth actually believe that. Resist the urge to laugh, act alarmed, or generate some other emotional reaction that might embarrass your conversation partner. More than likely they are saying such things because they haven’t really given it much thought, or perhaps because they have a low self-worth. Don’t give up on them, and keep asking questions to help everyone involved to get to the bottom of things.</p>\n\n<p>One of the simplest things you can do to see if your interlocutor really values truth or not is to ask if they visit a doctor, brush their teeth, don their seat belt before driving off in their car, or any number of other examples. Here’s a brief example from a recent tweet I made to help illustrate the point:</p>\n\n<p>Matthew: \"I don't care if I am believing in something that is not true.\"<br>\nAnthony: \"Are you content with your child's pediatrician holding that same view?\"<br>\nReference: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/magnabosco/status/902648886027853824\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/magnabosco/status/902648886027853824</a></p>\n\n<p>Every so often a person will double down on their low valuation of truth. I was once video chatting with a woman who believed in Jesus because her daughter nearly died when she was born, but prayers in the hospital made everything better. Her epistemology for knowing God was behind this miracle was faith. When I proposed a scenario where the woman could board Airplane A that was inspected by a qualified crew or Airplane B that was not inspected but she could use faith that it would be safe, she surprisingly said that she would board Airplane B. However, when I repeated the scenario, but this time it was her precious daughter that would be boarding the plane, she chose Airplane A.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Simply shifting the person being affected from my interlocutor to someone my interlocutor loved helped reach a breakthrough: the woman had a low value of truth when it came to herself, but not the loved ones in her life. The talk could then shift to why a person’s value of truth might be different when the individual in question varied.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to assess someone’s commitment to truth is to simply point to one of their valuables and proclaim that it is now yours because “it’s true for me.” Very few people are going to allow you to walk away with their cell phone or car keys because you’ve made it true in your mind.</p>\n\n<p>I once used this approach with a young woman on a hiking trail that I had already built a great deal of rapport with to illustrate the point:</p>\n\n<p>Anthony: “Could you be holding a belief that makes you happy, but might not be really true?”<br>\nClara: “I feel like it’s true to yourself and that’s all that’s really important.”<br>\nAnthony: “Do you really live that way?”<br>\nClara: “Yeah.”<br>\nAnthony: “Do you?”<br>\nClara: “I mean, as long as I feel it’s true. Why shouldn’t I find my truth in what I believe in and what makes me happy? Why shouldn’t everyone do that?”<br>\n&lt;long pause&gt;<br>\nAnthony: “You know, I’m really thirsty right now, and you’re actually holding my water bottle.”<br>\n&lt;Anthony casually reaches over and removes the water bottle from Clara’s hand&gt;<br>\nClara: &lt;laughs uneasily&gt;<br>\nAnthony: “It’s true for me.”<br>\nClara: “If that makes you happy…”<br>\n&lt;short pause&gt;<br>\nClara: “You stole my water bottle.”<br>\nAnthony: “I stole it?!”<br>\nClara: “I mean, it, that is, you took it, it wasn’t yours, it was mine.”<br>\nAnthony: “If it was true for me that it was actually mine, would it make it true?”<br>\nClara: “Well then you’re probably just a little...that would make you a little off.”<br>\n[both erupt in friendly laughter]<br>\nReference: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/V6IKSIXq6oY\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/V6IKSIXq6oY</a></p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, very few people will say they don’t value truth and really mean it. Sadly, however, there are some people who really don’t care if they are believing in untrue things. Unfortunately, I don’t have a great deal of advice for dealing with people like that, except to perhaps move on to someone else, like this person’s spouse, children, or other people in their circle who might be influenced by such thoughts.</p>\n\n<h2>We’re in this Together</h2>\n\n<p>It is my hope that this article has demonstrated the importance of identifying where our conversation partners stand on their view of truth, and provided you with the tools needed to conduct the “truth test” before examining a person’s deeply-held belief. Being aware of this potentially huge obstacle (and how to maneuver when you spot it) should greatly reduce conversational frustration and make for a more efficient and rewarding exchange.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that many people may have never given these concepts much thought, and are often responding with answers that just feel right. Be patient and work with your interlocutor by asking questions that carry out the “truth test” in a way that helps everyone better understand their views.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, share those situations where you have encountered relativistic thinking with others in the various Street Epistemology communities and discuss which approaches you found effective or where you encountered a surprising new roadblock. Only by addressing these truth challenges head-on will we be able to overcome this potentially frustrating roadblock before we can advance to examining the epistemology behind a person’s claim.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.anthonymagnabosco.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Anthony Magnabosco</a> is a provisional atheist and practitioner and promoter of Street Epistemology.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br>\n&nbsp;</p>",

I'd amassed enough of a library of my stock responses to standard apologetics that I thought sharing those strategies could be beneficial to others. My tutorials and other articles have garnered about five thousand or so casual viewers worldwide thanks in no small part to some exposure from AronRa, the president of the Atheist Alliance of America. He’s graciously given me a plug for an article I'd written about him, Matt Dillahunty, and Seth Andrews for the Infidels.org website which lists Richard Carrier and some other prestigious names among their advisors.\n\n</p><p>\nI may need to pause here to go get a broom and clean up all the names I dropped. Sorry for that. My intent was to establish that, while it’s only a hobby, the StupidAtheist.com website is something I take seriously, even when I'm being frivolous about my seriousness.\n\n</p><p>\nPeople have written and thanked me for some of my notes on the way I handle certain arguments and, for everybody who has ever dropped me an email like that, I'd like to offer a sincere \"Thank you.\"  I'd also like to say, \"Please stop using most of the advice I'd offered you. I think I was wrong. I think I may have been very, very wrong.\"\n\n</p><p>\n\"Gosh, Stupid Atheist, how were you wrong?\" some of you who apparently speak like kids from 1960s sitcoms might be asking. Forgive me, but I need to drop two more names:  Peter Boghossian and Anthony Magnabosco. \n\n</p><p>\nMr. Boghossian conceived, outlined, and I believe coined the phrase “Street Epistemology” and Mr. Magnabosco subsequently became a black-belted ninja of the discipline. As gently as possible, Street Epistemologists simply want to plant a seed of doubt, sometimes referred to as \"leaving a pebble in their shoe.\" It's a chess match, but an accomplished SE practitioner can make it look more like Tic-Tac-Toe.\n\n</p><p>\nWatching hours worth of Boghossian and Magnabosco videos made it crystal clear what I've been wrong about, and it's this: I was trying to use reason to counter the unreasonable. That's akin to fighting their asbestos suit with a flamethrower; they're just going to layer on more protection as things get hotter. And (as anybody in a relationship can attest) you can't simply scream \"YOU'RE BEING UNREASONABLE!\" and expect to score any points on your side of the argument.\n\n</p><p>\nIn fact, we might need to consider abandoning the argument itself altogether, though perhaps not in every circumstance. Debating is fine in a formal debate setting. But for me at least (and a lot more of us, as the SE tactics gain traction, and subsequently, acolytes) it comes down to this:\n\n</p><p>\n<b>If you really want to change minds, you've probably got to change tactics.</b>\n\n</p><p>\nIn my defense, I seem to have gotten it somewhat right in an article I'd written titled \"You’re an Idiot, But Don’t Take It Personally.\" Easier said than done, when the person you're having a conversation with keeps insisting your children deserve to spend eternity in torment just because you've raised them to be critical thinkers. \n\n</p><p>\nBut you've got to keep your cool, at all costs. You're talking somebody down from the ledge of irrationality. This is a fellow human being whose faith is like a band-aid. They may well suffer some pain at having it removed and recoil as a result. So be aware of that. Be sensitive to their sensitivity. And as the Prophet Aaron Rodgers told us in the book of NFL, Season 50, verse 2015: \"Relax.\"  \n\n</p><p>\nVerily.\n\n</p><p>\nStreet Epistemology as I practice it lacks the actual \"Street.\" I'm more comfortable in the online realm, because it allows me the time to compose myself as well as my sentences. Maybe that'll change some day, but for now I'm keenly aware that I lack the patience, fortitude, and frankly, the nads required to do this stuff face-to-face.\n\n</p><p>\nNonetheless, some of my online encounters have begun to pay off. For the most part, I'm a fixture in the Disqus chat forums used by a number of online news and blog services. My conversations can often be found in the Religion forum. And here's the weird part:  since adopting the Street Epistemology-esque tactics, I've made more than a few devout friends online.\n\n</p><p>\nInsofar as we (apostates and infidels in general) need to make inroads toward amending our image as abrasive buttholes, I think establishing these sorts of relationships is important. I'll use a conversation from this afternoon to tell you why. This isn't an SE exchange specifically, but it's one example of why the aftermath of those interactions is as important, I think, as leaving pebbles in shoes.\n\n</p><p>\nI'm typing this on Thanksgiving eve, and just got hailed by a Christian I've spoken with many times who I suspect might be bipolar. He'll often get overheated by my inquiries, but I can usually calm him down by rephrasing questions, explaining that I'm sincere in my curiosity, or by simply assuring him that no offense was intended and offering an apology. In any case, this is a guy who has told me on a number of occasions that he was done talking to me and that my family and I were doomed to a torturous eternity at the hands of his loving God, all the while peppering in a few not so “love-thy-neighbor”-ly invectives for good measure.\n\n</p><p>\nFor your convenience, I've copied and pasted our exchange from this afternoon below, with the name of the interlocutor (IL) changed as a courtesy to him.\n\n</p><p>\nPete:  Long time no see! So you changed your picture. What happen to the A. [Note:  I’d recently changed my avatar from an ‘A’ to a thumbnail of my eyeball.] Hope your [sic] having a great day.\n\n</p><p>\nStupid Atheist:  You too, Brother Peter!  I thought I owed it to people to look 'em in the eye while conversing.  ;-)  [Note:  Another theist Like'd this comment.] \n\n</p><p>\nPete:  Are you ready for turkey day? [Note:  He goes on at some length to share his plans with me to enjoy an Amish-style dinner.]\n\n</p><p>\nStupid Atheist:  Nice. We keep meaning to do that. Thanks for the reminder; I'ma put it on the calendar for next year.\n\n</p><p>\n[Note:  I went on to likewise elaborate on my family’s holiday plans here. Please keep in mind, when we first spoke, this guy was positively gleeful about the notion that I might someday burn for all eternity for being disrespectful of his deity.]\n\n</p><p>\nStupid Atheist:  Hope you have the best of holidays, my friend. Apologize to the Guy Upstairs for my disregard of the first of the Deadly Sins tomorrow. I'm down 35 lbs this year and I'm gettin' my gluttony on.  Xapis...\n\n</p><p>\nPete:  You and yours have a great holiday.\n\n</p><p>\n= = = = = = = = =\n\n</p><p>\nGranted, that's not specifically a Street Epistemology exchange. What it IS, though, is evidence that relationships can be formed with complete strangers despite our (sometimes vitriolic) differences, SE is a great tool for creating those types of common bonds rather than drawing divisive lines in the sand between us.\n\n</p><p>\nPlease understand, prior to adopting this sort of methodology, I routinely allowed arguments to emotionally escalate to the 'scorched Earth' level. Pooh-pooh the Bible all you like, but I am a HUGE fan of Hammurabi (“...an eye for an eye…” and all that). If somebody else dropped their gloves, mine came off, too.\n\n</p><p>\nI'm confident that I'm on a number of blocked/ignored lists as a result of my reactionary nature, and that haunts me. Those bridges are burnt and any chance I might have had to make a lasting connection is lost. Perhaps I won some arguments along the way, but I've accomplished almost nothing toward winning hearts and minds, and those people I've alienated may now be closed off to considering the value that any other infidel might bring to the table.\n\n</p><p>\nThat's tragic, and we shouldn't let it happen. I try earnestly to keep that in mind when things flare up emotionally.\n\n</p><p>\nThere's a demonstrable payoff to that approach. A prolific Catholic apologist on Patheos often takes the time to respond in great detail to my honest, non-confrontational questions. Our latest conversation prompted two of his devout readers to engage me, and our conversations have gone on now at length. The last reader to chime in inserted themselves into the conversation with this statement:\n\n</p><p>\n\"... such a cordial discussion is a precious thing to read and of course some thoughts of mine pop up in my head.\"\n\n</p><p>\nFor me, the fact that a Christian felt comfortable approaching an atheist stranger in a non-confrontational manner like that is itself a huge win. No, I haven't won an argument, I haven't one-upped the devout on any point of contention, but I've won enough of their respect and attention to begin having a productive dialog in earnest which, on several occasions now, has resulted in humble introspections and even retractions from my new devout friends online. And I think that's huge.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>If we're content to win hearts today, I think we'll have a far easier time winning minds tomorrow.</b>\n\n</p><p>\nXapis...\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Author Bio</h2>\n<p>\n The Stupid Atheist is a Cheesehead (resident of the state of Wisconsin in the USA) who had whatever potential for religious faith he might have had beaten out of him as a kid by Catholic nuns. That's a bad reason to be an atheist, but it's a helluva motivator for an inquisitive kid to give serious consideration into becoming one.\n\n</p><p>\n\n\t\t</p>",

Due to the impromptu nature of this encounter, I was unable to record it. I wanted to share it due to the quality of the experience, with Anthony's encouragement.</p>\n\n<p>First, a bit of backstory: I was sitting at Subway™ with my girlfriend to support and protect our friend who works there. She had just had a sandwich thrown at her by an irate customer, and was afraid he would come back. To pass the time, I brought in 'A Manual for Creating Atheists', which I am in the middle of reading for the first time. Our co-worker struck up a conversation with a new customer, 'Sammy'. Sammy is a pretty outgoing and chill guy. He empathized with her, and we all agreed that the irate sandwich-throwing customer was a huge jerk.</p>\n\n<p>As he turned to leave, he asked me what I was reading.&nbsp;<br>\nMe: \"Don't let the title throw you off, it's called 'A Manual for Creating Atheists'. It's more about how to have civil and productive conversations regarding faith.\"<br>\nSammy: \"But it's written from the atheist perspective?\"&nbsp;<br>\nMe: \"Yes, but the techniques can be utilized by anyone. It does have some built-in assumptions, such as that there is an objective reality that we can be right or wrong about.\"</p>\n\n<p>Sammy then talked about his perspective: that of an evangelical Christian. It was at this moment that I knew I was about to SE. I think my girlfriend sensed it, too; she got up to go talk to our friend at this point.</p>\n\n<p>I asked him why he believes in God. He told me about how before he became a Christian, he just lived for himself, and was into drugs and such to find his fulfillment. He emphasized that he is a more emotional person, and remarked that I seem to be a much more logical person (this came up a few times throughout the conversation). I made sure to clarify his position, and had him assign himself a level of certainty. He assigned himself a 99%.</p>\n\n<p>I then introduced the Outsider Test for Faith, using the example of a Hindu woman who has a similar story. His eyes went wide, and he said \"That's a very good question!\", and seemed to genuinely mean it. I clarified with him that he does think she is incorrect, that they can't both be right. He confirmed this, and I encouraged him by agreeing that I also think she is incorrect. I took this opportunity to gently press him one more time, asking how we could figure out which one of them is correct, since they are both using the same methods. He said \"Man, I need to think about that for a minute.\" I tell him to take his time; I planned to be there until the store closed.He proceeded to pause for literally about 20 glorious seconds, thinking of an answer. \"I don't know. How would you try to figure it out?\" He finally asked.</p>\n\n<p>Since he has been such a great interlocutor, I decided to answer his question. \"You mentioned how you and I both have different personalities; you're a more emotional person, and I am more analytical. But when it comes down to it, I want *reliable* ways of coming to conclusions; methods that consistently yield results that are aligned with reality. If you have an emotional method that is *reliable*, I am happy to use it.\" I then talked to him about the concept of falsification, and re-phrased the OTF by asking him how could we figure out who is *incorrect*. Another fantastic pause, and \"I don't know\".</p>\n\n<p>I marked this as the formal end of the conversation, but we continued talking. We clarified the definitions of \"Atheist/Theist/Agnostic\" by graphing \"Atheist and Theist\" along the vertical axis, and \"Gnostic/Agnostic\" along the horizontal axis, and I placed myself in the \"Agnostic Atheist\" block. He put himself in the \"Gnostic Theist\" block, saying that he is absolutely certain that God exists; that he is 100% certain. It sounded like his distinction between 99% and 100% certainty was semantics.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, Sammy showed that he is a natural Street Epistemologist, and asked me \"What would change your mind? What would shift you to the theist side?\"&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I first complimented him on the question, telling him he should really look into SE. Then I said that I will happily answer his question by first posing a thought experiment to explain my answer.</p>\n\n<p>I asked him whether he would believe me if I told him I owned a cat, and showed him a picture of me with my cat. He said \"Yes, absolutely.\"</p>\n\n<p>I asked if he would believe me if I told him I owned a tiger, and showed him a picture of me with a tiger. He said \"Not really.\"</p>\n\n<p>I then asked if he would believe me if I told him there was a dragon in my garage, and then showed him a picture of me with a live dragon. He said \"Not at all.\"</p>\n\n<p>I then asked \"Would you consider God to be more spectacular of a claim than a dragon?\"<br>\nHe grinned, seeing where I was going with this. \"Yeah, for the sake of the example.\"</p>\n\n<p>I said \"I would need something pretty darn spectacular. If all the stars in the sky re-aligned themselves into the words 'This is God, I exist, and I am also the Christian God specifically', and everyone else in the world also saw it, then that would be pretty compelling, maybe even enough to shift me to the theist side. Of course, the idea that I live in the Matrix is also a possibility no more spectacular than God, so I would still have my doubts.\"<br>\nWe had a bit more banter at this point which I don't recall, but at some point I threw one last question at him, and asked \"How would the world look any different if you were wrong about God?\" Another \"I don't know.\"</p>\n\n<p>The conversation turned to my Ravenclaw scarf, and his enjoyment of the Harry Potter series. I almost recommended that he read the \"Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality\" fanfic, but I missed that opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>We closed on a very positive note. He called this \"No joke, the best conversation I have ever had.\"</p>\n\n<p>As a parting thought, he asked me to look up a particular personality quiz - he acknowledged that most of them are bunk, but he likes this one. I thanked him for the recommendation, and gave him a parting thought as well: I asked him to dwell on what reliable methods we could use to determine which God is the correct one. He agreed.</p>\n\n<h2>Mistakes</h2>\n\n<p>While I consider this to have been an unmitigated success, as he experienced several points of aporia and had such a positive view of the conversation, there are a couple things I forgot to do that I wish I had done. If and when I have a follow-up conversation, I'll be sure to remedy all three things:</p>\n\n<p>First, I forgot to get his contact info. I chalk this up to being brand new to this. Thankfully, he is a regular at that Subway™, so my girlfriend and her friend (who both work there) can get his contact info for me.</p>\n\n<p>Second, I forgot to explicitly ask (although I implied it heavily) \"If 'life changing experience' can be used to come to various conflicting beliefs, what does that say about its reliability?\"&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Third, I also forgot to ask \"If there's no way to know which one of you is correct/incorrect, is absolute certainty really the best place to be on this belief?\"</p>\n\n<h2>Things I did right</h2>\n\n<p>I managed to elicit doxastic openness (Sammy’s willingness to reflect) despite having all my atheistic cards on the table from the get-go. I did this by acting as genial as possible, to help lower any visceral defenses that might be put up. I’m sure Sammy’s natural open-mindedness played a large part in that as well.</p>\n\n<p>I reveled in the pauses. Usually, pauses in conversation beg to be filled. Since I am new to SE, I am not sure if this was an anomaly or not, but I loved them. Every passing moment of Sammy’s silent reflection was euphoric.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>SE can be used anywhere! Not only is it a great method for helping people question their faith, it also results in amazing conversations. Stay rational! And remember: “The map is not the territory.”</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Author Bio</h2>\n\n<p>Hi, my name is Alex.

I suggest reading the <a href=\"http://www.reasonablefaith.org/belly-flopping\">original post</a> before continuing.</em>\n\n</p><p>\nHello, Marshall. I spotted your letter to Dr. Craig about a recent encounter you had with an atheist who challenged your beliefs and left you feeling unprepared. Craig's post has comments disabled, and your experience reminded me of dialogues I've had with people who afterwards told me they felt like they too \"belly flopped,\" so I'm writing this as an open letter to you and everyone who may have had a similar experience.\n\n</p><p>\nThe description of your conversation with an atheist at your dinner party sounds similar to a method of talking with believers called Street Epistemology (SE). SE is a way of conversing with people in a way that helps them examine the methods they used to conclude that their beliefs are true. Rather than debating someone, SE focuses on the foundation of people’s beliefs, and not what they believe, which could explain why your attempts at apologetics were ineffective and the talk stuck with you. Based on what you’ve described in your letter, it’s possible that your conversation partner was engaging with you using this method.\n\n</p><p>\nYou wrote that you felt like you were on the defensive during the talk. Once I begin dialogue with a believer to understand why they believe their God exists I try to keep the discussion focused. I discourage changing the subject, for example onto my own beliefs, though I understand one may be tempted to do so when feeling challenged. To be fair, you should still have an opportunity to examine the atheist's beliefs and claims in a separate discussion or by agreeing to \"turn the table\" halfway through your time together. \n\n</p><p>\nI fully understand that these types of conversations can shake people up, Marshall. And your response afterwards is completely normal. People have later told me that they prayed to their God, sought advice from professional believers, or met with others who believe the same thing to build up their confidence again in the belief. Addressing the possibility that a belief is not true can be a difficult thing to do, but I urge you to do more than simply insulating yourself from introspection.\n\n</p><p>\nKeep asking questions, Marshall, from both inside and outside of your faith community. Continue to explore the reasons why you believe in a God. Do the reasons justify a high degree of confidence? Are your reasons similar to what someone who believes in a completely different God might offer? Is your confidence in those reasons testable in some way? If you ever find yourself in a similar situation again, I hope you will gladly participate in the talk, and perhaps even use the same conversational approach in return.\n\n</p><p>\nIt sounds like your dinner party conversation has started you on an exciting journey of inquiry, Marshall. Please <a href=\"http://anthonymagnabosco.com/\">contact me</a> if you would like to continue exploring how you arrived at your beliefs, or ask me how I arrived at my beliefs. This offer extends to anyone reading this who might be exploring their beliefs and wants to engage in discussion.\n\n</p><p>\nP.S.

In my case, I never expected that my first time doing Street Epistemology would be with a 71 year-old man. Yes, it was awkward and often halting and fumbling. It was, at times, embarrassing and in the end, not completely satisfying. Yet after my first experience, I know that I want to do it again and again with many and varied dialogue partners.</p>\n\n<p>Following such experience, I'm ready to dispense free advice to those anyone wanting to try Street Epistemology for the first time:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>Consent is critical</em> – First time or fiftieth time, make sure your to be clear about your intentions, and seek the consent of your partner to have a dialogue in which you ask questions about how they arrived at a belief. Whether someone you know or someone you have just met, you can obtain consent in a casual way as you build rapport.</li>\n\t<li><em>It’s just not the same online</em> – Before my first face-to-face dialogue I had been practicing Street Epistemology online for more than a year, mostly via email or Facebook messaging. It wasn't really SE though, often devolving into debate and my dialogue partners would eventually stop replying, without wrapping up the dialogue.</li>\n\t<li><em>Watching videos is nothing like the real thing</em> – I watched a lot of videos on YouTube and even produced a few breakdowns of my favorite videos from Anthony Magnabosco and Reid Nicewonder. While videos give you ideas of what to do, they are far from the real thing. You know your skill only when you are forced to perform.</li>\n\t<li><em>You don’t have to go all the way</em> – I've learned that it's ok pull out of the conversation if you find yourself regretting your choice of partner. If your partner is very inexperienced, failing to distinguish between believing and knowing or thinking that all truth is relative, you may have to keep it at first base with simpler examples like the Tic-Tacs or the Ferrari keychain.</li>\n\t<li><em>Take it slow</em> – You may be so anxious to try SE for real that you are at risk of moving too fast. Don’t rattle off a series of questions you’ve been dying to ask. Truly listen to your partner and allow plenty of time for pauses.</li>\n\t<li><em>Recording it, if you're into that</em> – If you want to record you may find it awkward if you're not well prepared, especially in spontaneous encounters. I've tried using smartphone voice memos, not for posting but just to evaluate myself. Be aware you should never record or publish without the informed consent of your partner.</li>\n\t<li><em>Accept that you will probably be terrible at first</em> – If you feel unsatisfied at the end of the conversation, your partner probably feels similarly. That’s okay: a lot of it depends on your partner, and with practice and constructive feedback, you can improve.</li>\n\t<li><em>Think about what you did right</em> – While I wasn’t perfect, when I listened to my conversation I realized that I did focus primarily on my partner. I let some things slide and missed opportunities for probing questions, but it went better than I expected.</li>\n\t<li><em>Ask if you can get together again</em> – I had invited my dialogue partner to an astronomy event where I would be speaking on critical thinking. He didn’t show and it left me wondering whether the conversation had made a positive impression. Maybe I planted a pebble in a shoe, but I may never know, and have to be okay with not knowing.</li>\n\t<li><em>Don’t rush into the next experience</em> – Whether your first-time experience was terrific or so-so, don’t feel pressured into doing it again until you are ready. Being ready requires knowing why you are doing it in the first place. What if you are just trying to feel like you have the truth? That's no good for your partner. Try watching how others do it and learn from them how to make the experience more satisfying for both of you.<br>\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Mortgage Hill Musings makes a living teaching science concepts.

      "embrace-the-tentative": "<p>\n \t \t\n</p><h1>Embrace the Tentative</h1>\n<p>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-534471447/ep-135-blog-post-embrace-the-tentative-veridor\">Listen to the audio version</a>\n\n</p><p>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/sea-ice.jpg\"> </p><p>\n\n</p><p>\nFlip-flopper... wishy-washy... indecisive. Society conditions us to to avoid these pejoratives. How often have you heard “stand your ground,” or “go with your gut,” or “don't back down”? President George W. Bush famously exhorted the American public to “stay the course” no matter how much the situation in the Iraq war began to deteriorate. But where does this leave us when we discover that we've been on the wrong course? If the captain of the Titanic had seen the iceberg ahead of time, would he have been wise to stay the course no matter what? \n\n</p><p>\nReason offers a superior, more rational alternative: embrace the tentative. It’s quite alright to be wrong! If we leave no room for flexibility in our beliefs and opinions, we also leave no room for growth, increasing knowledge, or re-shaping our views to better comport with reality.\n\n</p><p>\nFor some background, I’d like to highlight one of the pivotal moments in my journey away from faith. I was watching a debate over creation vs evolution between Bill Nye and Ken Ham. Toward the end, one of the viewer-submitted questions was “what, if anything, would <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/z6kgvhG3AkI?t=2h3m59s\"> change your mind</a>?” Ken Ham responded first and simply stated that he was a Christian, and that no one is ever going to convince him that word of god is not true. Bill Nye, however, replied that evidence would change his mind – that even one fossil in an unexpected layer of the fossil record would change science forever. Though I'd had doubts about the religion of my upbringing since as long I can recall, this was a “light bulb over the head” moment for me, as it left me wondering why people would be so defiantly steadfast in a belief that is demonstrably and objectively shown to not comport with reality. I was utterly baffled at how someone could be so inflexible in light of seeing new information and evidence. Somehow, our culture sees reevaluation and reconsideration of our positions as anathema when once it was extolled and praised.\n\n</p><p>\nThis is especially apparent in politics recently. We see time after time how the public and the media pundits will excoriate a politician if he or she changes his or her position on the hot-button issue <i>de jour</i>. Both Hillary Clinton and Dick Cheney were in the past opposed to gay marriage, only to later change their personal positions on the issue. As a result, both caught flak for being inconsistent and simply going along with the times. They were accused of being flighty or simply pandering to the LGBT community for votes. It's no small wonder, then, that much of our politics as of late seems divisive and bereft of compromise. The next time an elected official changes their stance, imagine how refreshing it would be to hear a reporter or voter ask “what led you to change your mind?”\n\n</p><p>\nAfter discovering a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/magnabosco210 \">Street Epistemology YouTube channel</a>, I now know that we need to stop simply offering up counter-evidence to unreasonable positions and claims. Not only must we explore how we arrive at beliefs, but we must model openness and a willingness to revise our positions as needed when presented with new, better information. Show society that it's quite alright to change your mind. Surely as one changes their commute when confronted with a road closure, we must also throw off the shackles of sacrosanctity we have affixed to deeply-held beliefs. Confidence is acceptable, dogmatic doggedness will do little other than lead us down the road to ruin.\n\n</p><p>\nAlong this vein, on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/bBB-egqxH4c?t=45m5s\">February 19th, 2017, episode of the Atheist Experience</a>, Matt Dillahunty observed the following in a monologue that “Finding out you're wrong can be painful... The good thing about finding out you were wrong is that you're not wrong any more.” I couldn't agree more! It's OKAY to be wrong! Transitioning away from unsound positions and flawed epistemology towards sound, well-founded positions is a net win, and should be considered a virtue. \n\n</p><p>\nSo, I urge us all: embrace the tentative! \n\n</p><p>\nI’m reminded of a Chinese proverb: “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wussu.com/laotzu/laotzu76.html\">A tree that is unbending is easily broken</a>”. If we never leave room for revision, then we may unwittingly continue in false beliefs all our lives, never learning or growing from the experience. So bend with the winds of change: you may just come out stronger and wiser for it.\n\n</p><p>\n<i>Veridor is a network engineer, a skeptic, and a free-thinker who tries to model doxastic openness and embracing the null hypothesis.

It has bright lights, billboards, tourists, buskers, and of course, street preachers. In true Toronto fashion, it's a diverse group: the young guy with the megaphone who yells that you're going to burn in Hell is across the street from the old guy who mutters \"Believe!\" as he thrusts a crumpled tract in your direction. &nbsp;A few metres away some Muslim folks offer free copies of the Qur'an, while just a bit farther still are the Jehovah's Witnesses, quietly waiting for people to approach them and take a copy of The Watchtower. On some days you'll be asked to sign a petition to stop the persecution of Falun Dafa practitioners in China, and if you're really lucky you might have someone posing as a Buddhist monk ask you for money.</p>\n\n<p>I have been passing by this spectacle for years, but since I have never really wanted what these people were selling, I have averted my gaze and steered clear. It was only recently, after discovering Street Epistemology, that I first considered approaching one of these people and striking up a conversation. Ironically, though, the more I learned about SE, the less confident I felt. I had watched countless example videos, read “A Manual For Creating Atheists” and “The Outsider Test for Faith,” and had many conversations with strangers online, friends, and family members. I still felt unprepared to dive into a chat with these heavyweights. Sometimes I was in a rush, or not in the right headspace, but most of the time I just plain chickened out.</p>\n\n<p>Until last week.</p>\n\n<p>I found myself at Yonge &amp; Dundas on a beautiful summer night with nothing but time on my hands as I waited to meet my girlfriend. This was it. I stood on the corner for a bit, taking in the scene that I described above. There was a group of 3-4 Christians chatting with each other and lazily handing out their material, so I strolled over, fully prepared to just keep walking if they didn't approach me. Just when I thought I would have to try again some other time, a tall young man named Dave handed me a Chick Tract (it was called “The Bull,” in case you want to check it out). The conversation went something like this:</p>\n\n<p>Me: Ah, thanks man. Can you tell me about this thing you're handing out?</p>\n\n<p>Dave: This is called a tract. It's about<em> [gives synopsis of The Bull</em>], so basically we're all sinners and we can only be saved through Jesus Christ.</p>\n\n<p>Me: Ok, cool, I'll check it out. Do you mind if I ask you some questions about that though?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Dave: Sure, that's why we're out here!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Me: Great, thanks. You said we were all sinners, and I guess I wanted to ask about that. Is everyone a sinner, including that little girl?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Dave: Yes, everyone. Jesus said <em>[some Bible verse read from his phone]</em>, so the nature of man is to sin, and someone has to pay for that sin, which is where Jesus comes in. It also says<em> [another Bible verse],</em> so since it's our nature to sin, that girl will sin eventually, just like all of us. That's why we need Jesus.</p>\n\n<p>Me: Ah, ok. I guess I can understand that idea. It looks like you place a lot of importance in what the Bible says, is that right?</p>\n\n<p>Dave: Of course! The Bible is the ultimate source of truth. You see, <em>[long rant about how evolution is “just a theory,” immorality is everywhere, God's law, etc]</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Me: Wow, you threw a lot at me there! I want to go back to the first thing you said: the Bible is the ultimate source of truth, right?</p>\n\n<p>Dave: Yeah, it's true.</p>\n\n<p>Me: Ok. I'm not saying I can do this, but if it could be shown that the Bible wasn't reliable, that it got something wrong, what effect would that have on your belief in god?</p>\n\n<p>Dave: <em>[Looks at me, looks up, looks at his phone, looks back at me.]</em> Uh, I don't know. I've never thought about that before... but... the Bible is true, so...</p>\n\n<p>Me: If I can ask another question—that gentleman over there is handing out copies of the Qur'an. If we assume he says that the Qur'an is the ultimate source of truth, how could we determine which one of you is right?</p>\n\n<p>Dave: Uh, well I don't know much about the Qur'an...</p>\n\n<p>Me: Neither do I, but do you think there's a way we can find out which of the two books are reliable?</p>\n\n<p>Dave: Um... I mean, I think you should talk to Wendy. She knows a lot more about this than me.</p>\n\n<p>Me: Well, I'm happy to talk to Wendy, but I—&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Before I could explain that I wanted to know what he thought, Dave cut me off by walking over to his friends. He said something to one of the women, presumably Wendy, and she followed him back to where I was standing. She asked, “So you have some questions about the Qur'an?” I quickly clarified what I had asked.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Wendy was a much more seasoned apologist than Dave, and she seemed not only to have Biblical knowledge, but knowledge of the Qur'an as well. She asked, “Why would you want to follow that book? Did you know there are 99 different versions of it?” And then went on for a bit about all of the bad things about the Qur'an, specifically how Muhammad's wife Aisha was very young and how he brutally destroyed his enemies while keeping the girls as spoils of war.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Me: Wow, I really appreciate your knowledge on this. So just to be clear, and please correct me if I'm wrong, the Qur'an isn't worth following because there are many versions and because it is full of violence?</p>\n\n<p>Wendy: That's correct.</p>\n\n<p>Those of you familiar with the Bible know where I went with that, but she dismissed my question with the predictable “but that's the Old Testament.” That didn't stop her from talking about Adam, Job, and Noah, but I let it slide in an effort to avoid apologetics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We chatted a bit more until I came back to the same question I had asked originally: how can we know if the Bible is true? At this point it was Wendy's turn to tap out. “I think you need to speak to my husband Mark,” she said, and went to get him. He came over, said hello, and spoke for a while about Satan, about the Qur'an being a false teaching, and then about how personal experiences following an accident had lead him to Christ. It was a lot of information, and I was running out of time, but we were about to get to what I really wanted to discuss.</p>\n\n<p>Me: Thanks for sharing that. It sounds like some amazing things have happened in your life, and I'm glad you're doing better now. I guess my question is similar to what I asked Dave, which is how we can be sure that the god of the Bible is the one who helped you through that time?</p>\n\n<p>Mark: Ah, well, you have to have faith!</p>\n\n<p><br>\nMe: You use faith to know that god was helping you?</p>\n\n<p>Wendy: We all use faith every day. If I gave you a chair to sit on, you would have faith that it would hold you up, right? You would sit on it without hesitation.</p>\n\n<p>Me: I would trust it, partly because I’ve sat on many chairs before, partly because it seems like I can trust you not to give me a broken chair to sit on. Trust might not be the same as faith. But if, like you say, we all use faith, and the Muslim over there uses faith the same way you do, how do I know who's right? Is faith a reliable way to discover the truth?</p>\n\n<p>Mark: Well faith is how we are able to know God, so I rely on it.</p>\n\n<p>Me: Is there anything else that you use faith for? <em>[This garnered only a confused look.]</em> Let me ask that a different way. Would I be able to use faith to come to any conclusion?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mark: Well I guess so, but you have to make sure that your conclusion is right.</p>\n\n<p>Me: Sure, but if you're using faith as a method, it might be tough to know how right you are.</p>\n\n<p>Wendy: Have you gotten down on your knees and opened your heart to Jesus? If you do, you'll hear him talk to you and you'll be saved.</p>\n\n<p>Me: What if I did that this morning but didn't hear anything?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mark: Then you need to do it again!</p>\n\n<p>Me: Do I just keep doing it until I get the result I want?</p>\n\n<p>Wendy: You keep doing it until you're saved!</p>\n\n<p>At this point I was late. I thanked them for their time and tried to excuse myself, but Wendy asked if they could pray for me. I said sure, and she grabbed me by the hand, with Dave grabbing the other. Mark rounded out the circle. “Oh, you mean right now?” Yes, she did. They lowered their heads while Wendy prayed that Brian would let The Lord into his heart, and ended with, “I'll ask you Jesus, will you forgive Brian if he opens his heart to you? I just heard him, he said that he will forgive you.”</p>\n\n<p>I don't know who Brian is, but it's good to know he's eligible for salvation.</p>\n\n<p>As I was wrapping things up, I said that I had one more question for Mark.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Me: Is there anything that would change your mind?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mark: <em>[without hesitation]</em> No.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Me: Not that I think I could do this, but what if it could be shown that the Bible wasn't what you think it is? That it had errors, or that the events didn't happen the way they're written?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mark: That wouldn't matter to us because we would have an answer for anything you could come up with. We wouldn't have to change our minds.</p>\n\n<p>I thanked them for their time, shook their hands, and went to meet my girl.</p>\n\n<p>I know that there are some things I could have done better. I could have asked more open-ended questions, asked where they were on the “belief scale,” been more comfortable with politely interrupting when they got off on a tangent. I also know that letting my interlocutor tag out of the talk when they became uncomfortable was not ideal, since they were able to avoid the true introspection I was aiming for.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, I'm considering it a win for a few reasons. First, I kept myself on track, and I asked questions even when I wanted to state facts (about evolution, Noah's flood, or violence in the Bible). After long strings of Bible verses and apologetics, I was able to say things like, \"I appreciate your knowledge of those topics, but you said a lot there and I'd really like to get back to the first thing you said.\" Second, I got the responses \"I don't know\" and \"I've never thought of that before\" a few times, mostly from Dave. He was very quiet as I spoke with his more experienced partners, but treating him as an audience was helpful to me, and I hope that he left with some things to think about. Third, we had a very cordial chat, and we parted ways with smiles and handshakes.

      "getting-students-involved": "<p>\n</p><h1>Getting Students Involved</h1>\n<p>\nBy: Ben G. Williams\n\n</p><p>\n<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-534471447/ep-129-blog-post-getting-students-involved-ben-g-williams\">Listen to the audio version</a>\n\n</p><p>\n</p><center><img src=\"/assets/images/kids.jpg\" style=\"width:80%;\"></center>\n\n<p>\n</p><h2>Introduction</h2>\nHigh school and college campuses need more people like you, because students are in a unique position to find paths to good epistemology without decades of indoctrination getting in the way. I think we need do more to change the way secular students engage their peers. Too often, students resort to dismissive language rather than investigating the methods by which their friends arrive at conclusions. College students have enough struggles without the added difficulties that result from damaged relationships.\n\n<p>\nI remember the first time I understood how effective Street Epistemology (SE) could become: “How could it be,” I thought to myself, “that I have wasted so much time arguing about the existence of a god that I missed a much greater opportunity? The world would be a better place if everyone used reliable methods to arrive at their conclusions.” This realization was exhilarating because, “At last!” I thought, “I have found the method that I’ve been looking for!” It is my intention to share that appreciation for SE with students around the country. \n\n</p><p>\nUnfortunately, I see many secular students using combative techniques in conversation with believers. Sometimes, by arguing with family members, students sever crucial supportive relationships. One should not have to risk one's livelihood to defend one's nonbelief. By learning SE, these students could hold respectful, effective dialogue and even strengthen their relationships. That said, even if you are skilled at SE, you might find it more difficult to keep a level head with frustrating family members than with friends and strangers.\n\n</p><p>\nHowever, students only have a limited amount of time outside their studies and social lives. How can they still learn SE techniques, and practice them in a constructive manner? What does an organization practicing SE on campus even look like? I hope you find the remainder of this article to be helpful in answering these questions.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Facebook Conversations</h2>\n<p>\nStudents, like everyone, tend to be doxastically closed on social media. But, through social media, I think they could do a lot to challenge their peers’ faith-based reasoning. For example, consider the following post:\n\n</p><p>\n</p><blockquote>\n“Hello friends! Preacher Chris Cruz once said, ‘God doesn’t want to be studied. He wants to be known.’ I needed this reminder today.” \n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nHow would you respond? If you followed some of the examples I’ve seen online, you might shut down the original poster with an insult. Now, imagine if every social media user did the same thing. How much critical thought would be employed or modeled for the original poster? What’s the likelihood of the original poster critically examine their sincerely-held belief as a result of your insult? The student Street Epistemologist should encourage fellow students to question potentially faulty reasoning methods instead of attacking people or their conclusions. Being doxastically closed from within will be the secular student’s downfall. SE must be taught in secular clubs to provide a catalyst for critical thought and activate campus-wide intervention. \n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Epistemology Training</h2>\n<p>\nIn a recent Secular Student Alliance at Jacksonville State University (SSAJSU) meeting, I gave a Street Epistemology training presentation. The most effective segments of the training were a combination of observation and guided hands-on experience. Here’s the way I trained the club to use Street Epistemology:\n\n</p><p>\n</p><ol>\n<li>I handed out the SE Flow Chart from <a href=\"http://damndad.com/street-epistemology-process-flow-chart/\">damndad.com</a>. It is a general guideline and by no means the only way to go about SE. For our purposes, however, it served as a quick and dirty “How-to” guide for getting to the bottom of faith beliefs. \n</li><li>We broke down a short SE video by comparing the questions and answers from the video to the flow chart. At this point I further encouraged the future use of the chart, especially if one did not plan to study SE or secular literature.\n</li><li>I asked two volunteers to roleplay as SE and Interlocutor (IL) in front of the entire club for 5 minutes. It was important that we allowed comments after this part to give reminders of missed cues or offer possible alternative responses.\n</li><li>The entire club broke up into pairs to practice on each other for 5 minutes. \n\n</li></ol>\n<p>\nEarlier in the presentation, I encouraged a friendly and curious disposition. Near the end, I provided a list of resources such as this blog, the book “<i>A Manual for Creating Atheists,</i>” various YouTube channels, and the Atheos application. Now that we had completed a surface-level training, we couldn’t wait to practice the next day at our “Street Epistemology Tabling Event.” \n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Using SE as a Club</h2>\n<p>\nSo, what is a tabling event? At Jacksonville State University, campus organizations are allowed to set up tables in the student commons building near the food court. Club members took turns manning the table and engaging passersby for “A quick 5-minute chat,” about a deeply-held belief. To clearly state the purpose of our table, we made a poster displaying these questions:\n\n</p><p>\n</p><blockquote>\n“Would this campus be better if we all believed true things?”<br>\n“Why do you believe in a god?”<br>\n“Is everything you’ve been taught, true?”<br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/image00.jpg\" style=\"float:right; width:40%;margin: 2em\">\nWe carried out dozens of interventions over the course of those six hours. There were times when four club members were conversing with students of various beliefs. They took up a lot of standing room near the food court! We gained a ton of positive attention. Imagine the Student Government Association’s reaction when the Secular Student Alliance was generating more engagement than some of the largest organizations on campus! Most importantly, however, SSAJSU members were honing their ability to dig beneath surface level discussion about belief. The interlocutors even appeared to enjoy it!\n\n</p><p>\nNearly every intervention ended with a smile and a handshake. Many IL’s shared that they thought SE was a beneficial concept. They appreciated that, for Street Epistemologists, the goal isn’t to change minds; it’s to foster a genuine curiosity as to how people come to their strongly-held beliefs.\n\n</p><p>\nWhen I received feedback from the student Street Epistemologists, I discovered that for them, the most challenging part of the tabling event was interacting with IL’s about their epistemology without becoming combative. Later, I contacted the group members through social media to reassure them. Even if they felt discouraged by their performance, it is very likely that the seeds of doubt they sowed are taking root over the course of many days and weeks.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>\nIn conclusion, I urge you, the motivated student, to teach SE however you can. Give a presentation at your favorite club; stand with a sign outside the cafeteria door. And I urge you, the motivated community member, to reach out to your local campus. See if there is an organization that might be receptive to SE. Offer to speak or meet with their leaders, or pay for lunch with interested students. Why shouldn’t Street Epistemologists help encourage the sincere examination of strongly-held beliefs? Together, we will continue to bring about tangible, positive change in our communities. Thank you for the effort you will continue to put forth! \n\n</p><p>\n<i>Ben G. Williams (@ChatWithBenG) is the President of the Secular Student Alliance at Jacksonville State University.

      "godless-children-and-street-epistemology": "<p>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/godless-children-wide.jpg\">\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h1>Godless Children and Street Epistemology</h1>\n<p>\nby Julian Pugh\n\n</p><p>\nOur family lives in a highly religious community in the Bible Belt of Texas. It is not uncommon for us to attend birthday parties and even end-of-the-year school parties where parents pipe up and ask everyone to join in prayer before eating. Our daughter has even run into trouble with teachers in the past when it became public knowledge that she holds no god belief, so we've taught her to keep a low profile. At the same time we want her to be strong and independent. We don’t want her to feel she has to hide who she is or what she believes in, so we’ve stressed to her the importance and value of an understanding of SE. I've told her, \"You never have to make a knowledge claim with SE, you can simply ask others what they believe and ask why they believe it.”\n\n</p><p>\nI want to make three points with this blog post and this is the first one: if you have children, teaching them SE is a powerful tool for them to use in situations involving peer pressure, no matter what the subject of the pressure might be. Remind them that they are under no obligation to make any knowledge claim at all, but can simply request compelling evidence to help them make an informed decision. All the pressure then naturally rests on those trying to exert pressure. It's the ultimate social judo!\n\n</p><p>\nSo, early in my daughter's freshman year of high school she was at an after school club with several other students working on a manual task that required very little thinking. While their hands were involved in this mindless duty they were able to get into a discussion. An older boy made a comment about God and my daughter dodged it, so he got more assertive and flat-out asked her if she believed in God or not.\n\n</p><p>\n\"I don't really care, actually,\" was her response. She later described watching his jaw drop. “I mean, if there's a good reason to believe, I will. I just haven't ever heard any compelling reasons.” As she shared the story with me, she told me that he smiled a confident smile like he just KNEW that if he shared his “testimony” he would be inviting her to church by the coming weekend.\n\n</p><p>\nShe told me that the conversation continued for the next hour and she recounted it for me as best she could. She admitted to him that she holds no god belief but is open to any evidence. They addressed all the normal \"first-tier\" apologetics: Pascal's Wager, No True Scotsman, and establishing who has the burden of proof. She said it was hard to not get excited because she had heard ALL of these arguments hundreds of times watching \"The Atheist Experience\" (both online and live a few times) and was surprised that her Christian classmate had never really thought very deeply about any of this. “Why is it that atheists think more about this stuff than the people who actually claim to believe it?” she wondered aloud. I held back my desire to speculate that those who thought about it a lot might simply be more likely to become atheists. Instead I said, “Please continue with your story; I'm eager to hear what happened next.”\n\n</p><p>\nBut before I share with you what she shared with me, I want to make my second point about teaching SE to children. One of the ways we learn is by watching others do things. Watching the videos and live-streams of others performing SE strengthens our own ability to perform SE. Children today consume far more video than any previous generation simply because of its ready accessibility. If some of that content is SE then they are more likely to be familiar with standard apologetics, common logical fallacies, and good SE practices.\n\n</p><p>\nMy daughter continued the story of her first real SE encounter. \"Dad, the best was near the end, when I used the Outsider Test for Faith. I channeled your SE friends and said, 'I have a Muslim friend who said the same thing about Allah. How could I determine which is right if both of you use the same method to arrive at your belief?' Then I just sat there and he really thought about it for a long time. I knew not to start talking too soon, that you’re supposed to let them think about it, even though he looked really uncomfortable. So I just waited for him to say something first.”\n\n</p><p>\n\"What did he say?\" I asked, probably a bit too enthusiastically. \"He said, 'I don't know what to say. I'm really confused. Dude, my hands are shaking,' and dad, his hands were TREMBLING! But not like he was mad. He just seemed really perplexed. Then he asked me if we could still be friends because he wanted to talk more about this. I was like, 'Of course we can still be friends!' It was really cool.”\n\n</p><p>\nThe third and final point I want to make about SE in general and SE used by children in particular. People share their religious beliefs because they care. They might be misguided and uninformed, but generally speaking people care. Peer pressure is strong among young people because it is very important at that age to feel as though one belongs. This boy certainly wants to please his parents and his fellow church members, so he is doing what he thinks they want him to do. These tactics often work for the religious because they know that other kids want to belong as well and will often confess a belief in a god just to avoid “rocking the boat.” However our kids don't have to be ashamed of their lack of belief, nor do they need to shame others for having a belief. It is quite possible to be true to yourself while also maintaining a good friendship.\n\n</p><p>\nIf your child plants a seed of doubt for those with beliefs derived from faulty methodologies, then that's just icing on the cake.\n\n</p><p>\nUPDATE: Three months after this encounter, my daughter and this boy are still friends, though since then he has never brought up religion in her presence.\n\n</p><p>\n\n\t\t</p>",

Why won’t they talk about your claim directly? They constantly change the subject to ‘how confident are you in your claim?’ or ‘how do you know that?’ or, just like the three year olds they emulate, ‘Why?’</p>\n\n<p>If you thought that was a lot of questions, you haven’t met a Street Epistemologist yet.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t be fooled by their manipulative tactics. Just cut them off right at the start. Almost all Street Epistemologists use the scale, usually as soon as they hear your claim. &nbsp;If anyone asks for your confidence on a scale of 100, no matter if the scale starts at zero or one, just require that they define their terms clearly. &nbsp;They must provide a description of the scale with such clarity that you can understand what each number on the scale means or the question is not fair or honest. &nbsp;They are just trying to trip you up and use math tricks against you later. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Even if they manage to define the scale clearly, remember you are not obligated to play their game.</p>\n\n<h2>2 - ‘None of your Business’ Avoiding Critical Claims</h2>\n\n<p>You meet a stranger on the street that wants to LARP Socrates, and won’t even tell you their position on the topic you bring up. Why should you trust them? &nbsp;Simply don’t discuss any claims that matter to you. &nbsp;They require you to choose the claim, so pick something that makes no difference to you, so that doubt has no importance. &nbsp;What does it matter if someone talks you out of your favorite sports team, especially if in a sport you don’t care about? &nbsp;This way the Street Epistemologist gets their addiction to inducing doubt satisfied, and can feel good about themselves, and you can be a successful interlocutor while leaving your trust in what you truly really know to be true, unsullied.</p>\n\n<h2>3 - Multiply/Compound claims</h2>\n\n<p>Maybe you are careless, feeling cocky, and you make a claim that matters to you, one where, if you lost confidence in your claim, it might rock your world. &nbsp;Well, you daredevil, go boldly in confidence that these following tactics will keep you safe from these merchants of doubt.</p>\n\n<p>If someone insists on drilling down on your reasons you believe a thing, and you don’t want to get all the way to ‘it is either circular, infinite regress, or axiom’, just base the claim on another claim. &nbsp;This could be a new idea, or an idiosyncratic definition of a term in the claim. &nbsp;As long as you introduce at least one new idea in each answer, amateur Socrates will never pin you into a corner.</p>\n\n<h2>4 - Reject Hypotheticals</h2>\n\n<p>You know what you know, and no imaginary counterfactual should change your mind about what you know. &nbsp;The sneaky Socrates might try to shake you into uncertainty by proposing insane thought experiments designed to provoke doubt with fairy tales. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>‘Would you be as sure if you found out you were a brain in a vat?’ ‘What if the universe was created by some mindless quantum fluctuation?’ or ‘What if you found out that the trusted authority was wrong about things that you could check and/or had nefarious motivations?’ Street Epistemologists are constantly introducing destructive heresies like this.</p>\n\n<p>Some lazy pretend philosophers will even ask you to make up your own hypotheticals that go against what you believe. &nbsp;Such nerve!</p>\n\n<h2>5 - Demand Infeasible Hypotheticals</h2>\n\n<p>If you are willing to entertain hypotheticals at all, just make them impossible in practice, so that your claim will not be burdened by potential debunking. &nbsp;After all, if you are sure, this is just intellectually honest.</p>\n\n<p>The classic example is ‘the bones of Jesus, with DNA tests to show they are not anyone else’s bones slipped in to trick us.’ It’s impossible because DNA tests would have nothing to compare against.</p>\n\n<h2>6 - Win the Debate through Rhetoric</h2>\n\n<p>The best debaters aren’t milquetoast softies, they nut up and say what they mean, even if it is mean. &nbsp;Most of the time if you face down one of these ‘Don’t know it alls’ (Socrates joke) they will fold like a house of cards made of flimsy skeptical doubt.</p>\n\n<h2>7 - Stand Fast in your Confidence</h2>\n\n<p>You know what you know, and some upstart questioner that is only there to perversely shake your confidence shouldn’t lead you astray. &nbsp;If you find you don’t have good enough reasons to convince them, what does that matter? &nbsp;You did not come into this conversation prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give them reasons. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I’ve heard that most statistics are made up on the spot, so if you don’t want to be gullible and stupid, don’t change your mind on the fly. If someone brings up something you didn’t know that goes against what you believe, stick to what you know. &nbsp;You can always Bing! it later to see how full of shit they were.</p>\n\n<h2>8 - When it’s Okay to be Hostile</h2>\n\n<p>If someone yells fire in a crowded theatre, they are anti-social and should be rebuked in clear terms. &nbsp;Even freedom of speech has its limits. &nbsp;These Socrateasers hang out in parks, walking trails, and schoolyards trying to chip away at the confidence of any unsuspecting right-thinking person who is seduced into public intercourse by their seemingly innocent invitations and obsequious requests for consent.</p>\n\n<p>Many of them wear cameras and recording equipment trying to catch you looking confused and dumbstruck when they ask you some tedious, confusingly worded question. They even have a favorite term ‘spider on the ceiling’ or aporia—whatever that means. Don’t fall for it. &nbsp;You don’t need any time to remember what you already know. &nbsp;If they leave a long pause in the conversation, that’s probably a good time to tell them off for messing with people in places where children frequent.</p>\n\n<p>Think of the children.</p>\n\n<h2>9 - Watch that Clock</h2>\n\n<p>Street Epistemologists use an old tactic not unlike asking someone to call you out of a meeting before you go in. &nbsp;They do it blatantly and shamelessly by offering a timed conversation (usually 5 to 10 minutes) and will even tell you up front that the interview usually goes longer. &nbsp;This gets them out of whenever you are winning. &nbsp;If they engage with someone smarter than themselves, they can just bail when the timer beeps.</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t like how the conversation is going, just slow down, digress, meander, and pretend to be deep in thought (they love their ceiling spiders) and that beep will come quite soon and you are out of there.</p>\n\n<h2>10 - Call a Friend</h2>\n\n<p>If you are uncertain about anything you are asked about, check with someone you trust, or just Bing! it. &nbsp;Nothing wrong with making sure by asking outside sources. &nbsp;If they get all bogged down in theology, put them on the phone with your pastor. &nbsp;That’ll teach ‘em.</p>\n\n<p>Calling others in also really helps run down the clock.</p>\n\n<h2>11 - Flip the Script</h2>\n\n<p>Why is it fair for a stranger to ask you a stream of questions and just expect you to keep answering? &nbsp;Ask their position and demand they share it before you will disclose your own. &nbsp;It’s only fair. &nbsp;Their script requires them to stay neutral and secretive about their own beliefs, so they can’t be questioned. &nbsp;Try asking them questions and see how fast they bail if they are expected to be honest and transparent.</p>\n\n<h2>12 - Revoke Consent</h2>\n\n<p>These insidious interrogators are obsessed with their ritual of overtly spoken consent, as if anyone could have a conversation against their consent. &nbsp;Just refuse to be recorded or refuse to comply with their conversation rules or tactics. &nbsp;You can always just walk away, even if you started by consenting. &nbsp;Make sure you tell them they are not allowed to use any recordings in your parting shot.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>If you have taken in these strategies, you are ready to confront these atheist missionaries with the full protection of your confidence, given your new understanding of their motivations and tactics. &nbsp;They are few and rare, and if you play your cards right, they might realise the futility of their efforts and stop endangering the next generation with their foolish thinking.</p>\n\n<p>[End steelman mode.]</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p><em>Dali is JugglingLessons on Discord, and is often found lurking behind the @PracticeSE tag on the Street Epistemology server. &nbsp;Dali is developing training materials for SE, once he figures out what people need to bridge between reading a book/watching example videos, and actually engaging people live in public. &nbsp;Dali will now stop talking in the third person.</em></p>\n\n<p><br>\n&nbsp;</p>",

These options for understanding the method also serve as entry points for people who have never heard of it before. It fascinates me when I hear people report that their first exposure to Street Epistemology (SE) may have been a chat they had with someone in virtual reality or in the comments section of a TikTok video.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Most are pleasantly surprised when they learn there are also books, videos, and robust communities that have formed over the years around this exciting method.</p>\n\n<p>Since there are now so many potential entry points into Street Epistemology, it could be a bit confusing for people who have discovered the method, want to learn more about it, but don’t know where to go next. I’m hopeful this blog post will serve as a “road map” and outline some of the directions one can head in order to start soaking things in.</p>\n\n<p>These are not listed in any particular order. Select what you think works best for you.</p>\n\n<h2>The Website</h2>\n\n<p>One of the first places anyone wanting to learn more about Street Epistemology should be the SE Website. While the site itself is not particularly magnetic, it’s a good place to familiarize yourself with some of the basics of Street Epistemology before launching off into the various SE communities.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to finding links to pretty much everything I plan to mention in this blog post, the website addresses many of the basic questions people unfamiliar with Street Epistemology may have. Here you can find answers to frequently-asked questions, watch the featured SE video of the month, read blog posts from people in the SE community, and even find a store that offers SE-themed merchandise.</p>\n\n<p>Originally fan-managed, the SE Website and domain name are now owned by the non-profit that was created in 2019 called Street Epistemology International.</p>\n\n<h2>The Books</h2>\n\n<p>Street Epistemology got its start with a book in 2013 called <em>A Manual for Creating Atheists</em>&nbsp;and a much-needed update in 2019 with <em>How to Have Impossible Conversations</em>. Interestingly, both books barely mention “Street Epistemology,” yet the concepts promoted in both books are foundational to the method.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Given the choice, I’d suggest reading Boghossian’s most recent book, as it’s broader in scope and includes more specific suggestions on how to apply the technique. It’s not uncommon, however, to meet accomplished practitioners who have never read either book, so don’t beat yourself up if you haven’t had time to investigate those yet.</p>\n\n<p>I personally think there may be a need for a more comprehensive book on Street Epistemology that covers the genesis, history, application, and potential of the approach. Maybe one day soon I’ll put something together.</p>\n\n<h2>YouTube Channels</h2>\n\n<p>Videos of people practicing Street Epistemology began surfacing around 2014. These discussions provided a stark contrast between the argumentative examples between theists and atheists that dominated the landscape. While in retrospect many of these video examples were fairly crude, recommendations from viewers (often from people with experience in philosophy, psychology, psychotherapy, and linguistics [to name a few]) helped many practitioners improve their interactions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While videos take more time to consume, they are often an entertaining way to learn Street Epistemology by simply observing a few interactions. If time permits, try to scroll down and read the video comments, where you can really get a sense of how these talks are impacting observers and the practitioners of the approach.</p>\n\n<p>The number of people uploading videos related to Street Epistemology seems to ebb and flow, and I personally cannot get enough of them. Watching examples where someone is using SE with another person to explore their claim can both be entertaining and educational. There’s something incredible about watching a person think about their thoughts that really highlights the potential of the SE approach.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It’s also quite encouraging to see people outside of the community discussing Street Epistemology—the technique is slowly getting noticed and is drawing lots of attention. Oftentimes, from <a href=\"https://youtu.be/GU12lJ020fE\" target=\"_blank\">surprising sources</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to following your favorite SE Content Creators individually, you can find an active list of current SE videos in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfb-sNm-sTE0fZQkynr-qTu6krq68S-po\" target=\"_blank\">SE Latest Releases Playlist</a>, which is managed by volunteers to help keep it updated.</p>\n\n<p>If you do have time to review the comments section of SE videos, please engage with the content creator, offer suggestions to them for improvement, and dialogue with others who have also left comments—all of this activity can help make SE better.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Also, sharing one of your favorite SE videos with friends and family is another way to generate discussion, model reflective thinking, and promote respectful discourse.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking as video content creator myself, it’s been nice to see the camaraderie between people who record and upload their SE talks to YouTube. Practitioners tend to have different styles, venue considerations, and even cultural differences that keep things interesting. If you do happen to stumble across a Street Epistemology video, please try to leave constructive feedback for the originator to read, as well as anyone else who may happen by later. I think critical yet supportive feedback is crucial to our growth.</p>\n\n<h2>TikTok</h2>\n\n<p>It’s been really exciting to see Street Epistemology taking hold on this particular platform, because lots of people of all ages are on it and the medium itself seems to inspire creativity. The video clips on TikTok are usually 30 seconds or less in duration, often include snippets of popular music, and showcase people saying or doing something interesting.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the “short burst” nature of most videos, this platform is great for taking complicated topics—something we often observe when doing Street Epistemology—and making them simple and digestible for viewers.</p>\n\n<p>Doing a search from within the TikTok app for the hashtag #streetepistemology will help you find active SE content creators, and is a great way to passively learn the method while being entertained along the way. I am very encouraged with this platform in particular as a way to introduce people to Street Epistemology in entertaining ways.</p>\n\n<h2>Discord</h2>\n\n<p>Discord is basically an online forum with a layout similar to a Windows Explorer file system, where instead of folders you have topic-themed channels where other people around the world can text, voice, or video chat.</p>\n\n<p>You’ve probably heard people talking about this platform, but don’t know much about it. I didn’t either until about a year or so ago. It apparently started off as a place for gamers to gather while playing online games, but the potential of this platform for the Street Epistemology community cannot be overstated.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone can create a Discord “server” and invite people to it. The largest server dedicated to Street Epistemology (just over 4,000 members at the time of this writing) has channels where people discuss SE, coordinate with teams working on SE-related projects, practice SE through role-play and real conversations, and even share their audio or video of their live interactions.</p>\n\n<p>One of my favorite channels is #introduce-yourself, where you can read how people from around the world first encountered Street Epistemology and how it has impacted their interactions. Although it takes a while to get comfortable navigating, the SE-themed Discord servers are my number one recommendation for anyone looking to find other people to engage with about this method.</p>\n\n<p>It will be interesting to see if Discord has the ability to scale alongside the increasing popularity of Street Epistemology.</p>\n\n<h2>Facebook Groups and Page</h2>\n\n<p>Although SE activity on this platform has seemingly waned a bit from it’s highs a year or so ago, it’s still a great place to meet others and share your experiences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There are currently <a href=\"https://streetepistemology.com/community/\">four main groups and one page</a> that you should be aware of, each with a slightly different focus to keep things organized:</p>\n\n<p><em>Street Epistemology Study Group</em> (Private group, 5.4K members): This was the first Facebook group created for people interested in Street Epistemology, and since the method was originally marketed to atheists only, that restriction for membership still applies. Most discussions center around the application of Street Epistemology. Make sure you answer any intake questions before submitting your Join Request.</p>\n\n<p><em>Learn Street Epistemology</em> (Private group, 2.1K members): As Street Epistemology expanded to explore other claims, a group similar to the Study Group was created for people wanting to learn more about the method, independent of where you happen to stand on any claim.</p>\n\n<p><em>Chat With a Street Epistemologist</em> (Private group, 1.3K members): This is the place for actually practicing Street Epistemology with someone on their claim. Although eclipsed by the aforementioned Discord servers, this is still a good place to go if you’d like to have one of your beliefs respectfully challenged, role-play a conversation you’re thinking about having with someone, or just practice.</p>\n\n<p><em>Critique Street Epistemology</em> (Public group, 500 members): A specific group dedicated to discussing criticisms and concerns about the method. Most of this type of discussion has also moved to the SE Discord servers, but you may still see an occasional post here or there.</p>\n\n<p>There is also a public Facebook Page for Street Epistemology that makes general posts about SE-related events or topics, but it’s not a very interactive place.</p>\n\n<h2>Reddit</h2>\n\n<p>With just under 10,000 members at the time of this writing, the Street Epistemology subreddit is a great place to keep up with our antics. While I personally don’t frequent this platform all that much, it seems like an underutilized resource that could benefit from some coordinated attention. It would be great to see a lot more SE discussions and &nbsp;activity on this search-engine crawled community.</p>\n\n<h2>The Street Epistemology Podcast</h2>\n\n<p>Audio only examples of Street Epistemology have been uploaded since 2015, and at the time of this writing, had more than 570k plays. The SE Podcast is available on a variety of different podcasting platforms, and is a great way to keep up with Street Epistemology.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The podcast not only airs examples where SE is being used, but blog posts, related shows, interviews with practitioners and members of the SE community, and much more. Each episode is currently played approximately 1,200 times.</p>\n\n<p>If you have been following the SE Podcast for a while, please consider leaving a review and/or comment for others who stop by to take a listen.</p>\n\n<h2>The Complete Street Epistemology Guide</h2>\n\n<p>A few years ago, a small team of volunteers assembled the <a href=\"https://streetepistemology.com/publications/the_complete_se_guide\">SE Guide</a>, based on our best understanding of Street Epistemology at the time. While it may be dated in a few areas, this document is still a great way to grasp many of the concepts related to Street Epistemology.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The SE Guide will likely be translated into multiple languages after the resource can be reviewed and updated as a formal project. The SE Guide is located under Resources on the SE Website.</p>\n\n<h2>Members of Your Own Tribe</h2>\n\n<p>As Street Epistemology grows in popularity, there’s a good chance a few people within your own groups of personal interest have also heard of it. A great place to practice and introduce people to SE are the very clubs and communities and groups that you are already a part of. This could be groups formed around knitting, guns, social justice, activism, politics, etc. Imagine the dialectical advantages your group can enjoy if they started to employ the SE toolset in their interactions!</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>That’s a pretty comprehensive list of the resources and communities that are currently available for people who are interested in learning more about Street Epistemology.</p>\n\n<p>I’m hopeful that you will consider interacting with people in these places to develop a better understanding of what we’re trying to build and accomplish with Street Epistemology, and in the process, help us create something even better.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p>Anthony Magnabosco is a practitioner and promoter of Street Epistemology, and is the current Executive Director of <a href=\"https://streetepistemologyinternational.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Street Epistemology International</a>.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>",

I can’t resist presenting counter-evidence, getting agitated, or ridiculing people who spout such nonsense!”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This question comes up so frequently that I decided to write this blog post with my observations and suggestions on how to best address this challenge. As I have mentioned in other blog posts, if I think of anything to add later, I will append my thoughts in the comments section below.</p>\n\n<h2><br>\nConduct a Self-Assessment</h2>\n\n<p>People often say it’s not in their nature to let egregious claims slide—they absolutely <em>have</em> to make sure the other person is aware just how mistaken they are. “I’m simply incapable of letting people get away with it!” is the explanation I often hear. Rather than give up completely, take a closer look at your strengths and weaknesses. Is there a particular type of person that tends to upset you the most? Is there a particular topic that makes you see red? Do you have expertise in a particular area and find those are the chats that trigger you most?</p>\n\n<p>Identifying which people or subjects have you struggling to maintain your composure will help you avoid those conversations and practice with safer topics for the time being. Recognizing that you always blow your lid when the subject of religion comes up, and yet you can easily keep your cool when discussing non-religious topics, can remind a person how rewarding productive dialogue can be overall.</p>\n\n<p>After you complete a conversation, reflect on the effectiveness and feelings of goodwill you likely experienced. Remind yourself of these successes on easier subjects before you re-engage with people on topics that challenge your patience and keep progressing forward.</p>\n\n<p>If you relapse, revisit those earlier, successful dialogues and slowly work your way back up.</p>\n\n<h2><br>\nKnow When to Stop</h2>\n\n<p>When I reflect back on conversations where I deviated from SE and ended up debating, it’s usually accompanied with the thought, “I wish that talk ended 30 minutes ago when we reached that high point.” In other words, I <em>was</em> having a respectful discussion, but then I didn’t know where to go next or I was getting fatigued, got sloppy, and then ended up arguing with the person. To make matters worse, the little good that <em>did</em> happen was usually overshadowed by the embarrassingly bad blowout at the end.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid dialogues turning sour, the first thing is to know your personal limits, so you can wrap up well before fatigue sets in. Also, watch out for gestures, words, or other indications that you or your conversation partner are starting to get heated. Crossed arms, aggressive hair flips, sighs of exasperation, and decreased or non-existent pauses between questions and answers could all be indications that it might be time to wrap up your talk.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If your discussion is text-based, snarky remarks, sarcasm, disparaging memes, uppercasing words, or near-instantaneous responses back (which may suggest a lack of careful consideration) could also be an indication that a break is in order.</p>\n\n<p>A simple, “It looks like things are heating up a bit and I’m concerned it might get in the way of our mutual understanding. So, if it’s alright with you, let’s end the talk for now but pick it up soon. Sound good?” Most people will agree to your suggestion, and many will take it as a kind gesture. If the person responds by goading you to continue or teasing you, that is absolute confirmation that you’ve made the right choice to take a break.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Don’t allow anyone to pressure you into continuing in an unpleasant or confrontational dialog. It’s always all right to gracefully exit a conversation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br>\nAssess Your Goals</h2>\n\n<p>We generally converse with people because we value these relationships and we think these individuals are worthy of being helped. It’s usually in everyone’s best interest to encourage people to reflect on their beliefs because we care about them, we want ourselves and others to hold accurate views of reality, and we recognize that a person’s actions based on untrue beliefs can cause real harm.</p>\n\n<p>So before you embark on your next SE talk, stop and ask what you are hoping to gain by engaging in a particular conversation. What is your objective by having a talk? What would you consider to be a success? How invested are you in the topic at hand? What repercussions might one expect from having a dialogue on this subject? Is it worth the time and effort to have a chat right now? Do I have time after the talk to be supportive if this person abandons their belief? Write your goals down or even share them with your interlocutor before stating the talk. Feel free to reference this list occasionally during the chat to ensure you are staying on track.</p>\n\n<p>Pay attention to your own motives and those of your interlocutor. One or both of you might enjoy debating and/or placing yourself in a competitive scenario where one must avoid \"losing\" at all costs (whatever that means). Sometimes, simply hearing or thinking about the views of “the enemy\" can trigger an angry response. In these cases you have to prepare your own state of mind to view the dialogue as a peaceful collaboration and not a battle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is also common for individuals to feel anger when discussing their former faith for some time after leaving a belief system. During that period it may be better not to engage with the more abrasive believers or those you've had angry exchanges with in the past. You might even consider working with a professional therapist at the <a href=\"https://www.seculartherapy.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Secular Therapy Project</a> to assist you in moving on. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>They Could Be Right</h2>\n\n<p>While at times this may seem far-fetched, remind yourself that your interlocutor could have a reliable epistemology and what they believe could be true, no matter how unlikely it seems to you in light of your current beliefs. Acknowledging your biases and striving to stay neutral during a talk is a great way to help a person stay emotionally detached from a conversation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Aim for inquisitiveness rather than aggressiveness. Model the openness you want your interlocutor to exhibit with your own candor and sincerity.</p>\n\n<h2><br>\nMind the Backfire Effect</h2>\n\n<p>Many select Street Epistemology as the approach of choice because we wish to avoid the “backfire effect,” the phenomenon where a person responds to attacks, facts, and counter-evidence by becoming even more entrenched in their views. Ask yourself, “If I respond with that, will it be harder or easier to continue making progress with this person?”</p>\n\n<p>Remind yourself that slipping into “debate mode” during a one-on-one talk will almost certainly impede your conversation and trigger that flight-or-fight reaction. &nbsp;This is so critical that you might consider keeping around this actual MRI image highlighting the amygdala in green and insular cortex in yellow, as a visual reminder to avoid triggering <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala_hijack\" target=\"_blank\">amygdala hijack</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p></p><center><img alt=\"MRI image highlighting the amygdala in green and insular cortex in yellow\" src=\"https://StreetEpistemology.com/img/52/mri-image.jpg\" style=\"height:200px; width:193px\"></center><p></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If a visual reminder like this could help you stay on track, print it out and tape it to your monitor, make it the wallpaper on your phone, or update your profile image during the course of an online discussion. Your brain and the brain of your conversation partner are going to respond in much the same way, so be aware of your own tendencies to hunker down when <strong>you</strong> are being confronted with ideas that do not fit your preconceived notions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While your conversation partner may not be familiar with the “backfire effect,” you now are, so the responsibility will likely fall on you to be aware of the potential pitfalls.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>A Slice of Pie</h2>\n\n<p>One source of conversational frustration is finding that the dialogue has looped back on itself, or not knowing exactly where to go next. Creating a reminder of the SE questions you wish to ask will likely help keep you from getting you worked up and resorting to your old, argumentative ways.</p>\n\n<p>In my talk to Chicago Atheist Society called ‘<a href=\"https://youtu.be/crHkQ93hizE?t=12m27s\" target=\"_blank\">Things I Have Learned</a>’, I discuss three categories of questions that usually come up during an effective SE-based talk. Grouped by importance, not frequency, remind yourself that you are striving to understand <strong>what</strong> a person believes (~10 percent), their justifications (<strong>why</strong>) for the belief (~20 percent), and <strong>how</strong> they determined that their methods for arriving at the belief were reliable (~70 percent).</p>\n\n<p>Please note that these percentages are not based on carefully calculated conclusions, but are merely trends I’ve noticed after participating in and reviewing hundreds of SE-based talks.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p></p><center><img alt=\"Pie chart: What, why, how.\" src=\"https://StreetEpistemology.com/img/56/what-why-how2.jpg\" style=\"height:179px; width:234px\"></center><p></p>\n\n<p><br>\nIf you find yourself becoming irate at your interlocutor, return to asking the more basic what-type questions, and then slowly build back to the why- and how-type questions, which will require more listening and patience. Revisiting <em>what</em> a person believes gives your conversation partner a chance to further explain their beliefs, will likely be perceived as genuine interest (which can foster goodwill), and gives you a little bit of time to regain your composure.</p>\n\n<h2><br>\nPretend There’s an Audience</h2>\n\n<p>One of the main things that helps me keep cool when I'm growing frustrated with an interlocutor is reminding myself that other people may very well be watching. &nbsp;Whether I am livestreaming over social media or recording a talk to upload later to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/magnabosco210\" target=\"_blank\">my YouTube channel</a>, I have to remind myself that my behavior is being observed very closely by lots of people (and not just by those who share my views).</p>\n\n<p>It’s very common for people to leave a comment on a video or message me directly to point out something that I said or did after watching one of my interactions. For example: “Never offer to shake a Muslim woman’s hand!”, “Why did you pronounce the word ‘epistemology’ slower for those two ladies?”, “Don’t <em>tell</em> people to have a nice day; you should say that you hope that they have a nice day!”, “You were awfully abrupt with that guy. Is something bugging you?”, and so on. At first, this was a little off-putting and I could feel myself getting defensive: “How dare they judge me! Show me a video of <em>you</em> trying this!” But as time progressed, I began to discover not only the value of this feedback, I began to realize that having people watching me was in fact helping me stay more calm, cool, and collected <em>during</em> the encounter!</p>\n\n<p>Even when engaging in a conversation that is not being recorded or broadcasted, I try to imagine what an audience watching the encounter might think. By pretending that others (from impressionable youngsters to my peers to my heroes) are intently watching my every move, I can usually dial back my frustrations considerably.</p>\n\n<p>The next time you start up a discussion, pretend that you and your interlocutor are standing on a stage in front of a large audience. Imagining this scenario should help you stay emotionally distanced from the topic being discussed and should keep you on your best behavior. In turn, your questions will probably seem less like an attack and more like an exciting, mutual exploration of ideas.</p>\n\n<h2><br>\nSee Victims, Not Victories</h2>\n\n<p>Rather than view your interlocutor as an enemy opponent or competitor in a contest, try to remind yourself that they are probably a nice person who just happens to be holding a mistaken view of reality. Many people have never been taught how to think critically, and simply lack the skills necessary to adequately question their belief claims. People like this are probably not stupid or deluded. They are merely unwitting victims of a faulty epistemology. We are obligated to try and help them!</p>\n\n<p>Reminding myself that no one is immune to this mental trap—even me—has been immensely helpful in keeping my cool when I encounter someone who is pushing all of my buttons. It’s also a bit liberating to recognize how easy it is to be mistaken, and that it’s alright to say, “You know, I’m really not sure why I think that’s true!” Viewing your conversation partner as a casualty of the fickleness of the human mind, rather than a foe who must be crushed, is extremely helpful in keeping those angry emotions at bay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br>\nCreate a Decompression Plan</h2>\n\n<p>By preparing for yourself a plan for dissipating your frustration after the dialogue, you may find it easier to keep your cool during the dialogue itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>After my nearly 30-minute long talk with an on-campus <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Tkpz5btDdgM\" target=\"_blank\">Christian minister who spouted all sorts of ridiculous things,</a> I waited until we shook hands, wished each other well, and he walked away before suddenly venting my frustration to the (probably now shocked!) livestream audience.</p>\n\n<p>Being able to disclose your conversation to others is essential, so give some thought as to which people in your circle can hear you out. Sometimes, simply making a tweet or post in one of the SE-based Facebook Groups about your experience will be enough to help get things off your chest and be more refreshed for next time.</p>\n\n<p>I have learned to leave the frustration, sadness, and pity I often experience from my chats out in the field. I don’t <em>want</em> to take it home with me. I have far too many conversations with people these days to become emotionally invested in them. And while that might seem heartless, I’ve decided that I cannot and do not wish to burden the loved ones in my life with such things.</p>\n\n<p>This is worth repeating: <strong>never</strong> direct your frustration at your interlocutor. Hold and get it off your chest later.</p>\n\n<h2><br>\nPrepare Yourself for Change</h2>\n\n<p>Coming to the realization that my own anger could be the biggest barrier preventing me from conducting an effective SE-based talk has been both humbling and motivating.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Humbling because I can look back and see how becoming aggressive has hurt feelings and damaged relationships, and motivating because this is one of those rare times where there is a factor that I actually have some degree of control over.</p>\n\n<p>These days, if someone starts to become irate with me, I’ve found that it is now difficult for me to match their anger. And it’s more than realizing that they will likely ramp things up even further if I did. If anything, I find myself becoming curious as to why they might be responding in such a heated manner and then sincerely offer to investigate their response if they are willing. People have asked me if I use mindfulness meditation to stay so calm, and yet I don't meditate. &nbsp;Maybe this is a hidden benefit of practicing Street Epistemology, of cultivating a Zen-like calm in an otherwise difficult situation.</p>\n\n<p>I have received countless notes from people over the years saying how much learning SE has had on improving their own temperament, conversations, relationships, and overall outlook on life. It’s truly inspiring to hear such things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And I can definitely relate to this feedback because I often feel this way about my own interactions and personal growth—it’s one of the things that inspires me to pour nearly everything I have into practicing and promoting this approach.</p>\n\n<h2><br>\nClosing</h2>\n\n<p>It is my hope that these suggestions and anecdotes will help you stay more focused and calm when you embark on your Street Epistemology conversations. While I still struggle occasionally, these concepts have absolutely helped me improve in more ways than one.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t expect to see improvements immediately. These things take time. Continue to remind yourself about your objectives, the things you can do when you detect that anger rising, and the feelings of satisfaction one can experience when you have helped someone honestly reflect on a deeply-held belief.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br>\n<em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/magnabosco\" target=\"_blank\">Anthony Magnabosco</a> is a provisional atheist as well as a promoter and practitioner of Street Epistemology.</em><br>\n&nbsp;</p>",

I actually like the idea of recognizing that there are some things that we could do without; in fact, there are some things that actually impede our ability to be our best. This year for Lent I’m giving up certainty. When I say “certainty,” I mean “absolutely no doubt / there’s-no-way-I-could-be-mistaken” kind of certainty. Street Epistemology is my tool of choice to help me steer clear of such certainty.</p>\n\n<p>The basic motivation for Street Epistemology is to assess one’s level of certainty in a claim and then scrutinize the method(s) used to arrive at that confidence. While the claims often tend toward the supernatural, that’s not always the case. For example, in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA4Vkn3iJi0\" target=\"_blank\">a recent video entitled “I’m My Mom’s Daughter,”</a>&nbsp;Anthony Magnabosco has a conversation with two young women. The first woman (Hafsa) claims, with 100% confidence, that the woman she calls “Mom” is indeed her biological mother.</p>\n\n<p>If one were to claim 100% confidence in anything, this belief would appear to merit such certainty -- our parentage is such a foundational belief that we have probably never even thought to question it. In my mind, this is where Street Epistemology shines brightest -- when it causes one to reconsider those important beliefs that are taken for granted, those that would otherwise not seem worth questioning.</p>\n\n<p>Street Epistemology rarely causes someone to abandon a strongly-held belief on the spot (going from 100% to 0%). What it attempts to do is to drill down to the method(s) being used to substantiate a claim and then make sure that the confidence in the claim accurately tracks with the reliability of the method(s).</p>\n\n<p>Yet we live in a culture, and perhaps are burdened with built-in brain algorithms, in which black/white, binary thinking appears to be the norm. Street Epistemology, in the interest of knowing as many true things as possible and as few false things as possible, advocates for a reconsideration of such absolute positions. Australian musician/comedian/entertainer <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGErC6QQdoc\" target=\"_blank\">Tim Minchin’s song, “The Fence,”</a>&nbsp;is a variation on this same theme:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>This is my song in defense of the fence<br>\nA little sing-along, an anthem to ambivalence<br>\nThe more you know, the harder you will find it<br>\nTo make up your mind, it doesn't really matter if you find<br>\nYou can't see which grass is greener<br>\nChances are it's neither, and either way it's easier<br>\nTo see the difference, when you're sitting on the fence</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While Minchin’s point is that there are advantages to taking a middle position, many will find the shift from certainty to uncertainty to be unsettling, and perhaps seemingly impossible. There is a reason that our politics have become polarized and so many have retreated to (and find comfort/community in) the echo-chambers of certainty found in social media. How do you tactfully and respectfully jog someone who is comfortable with certainty (even if the certainty appears to be inadequately founded) to take a less comfortable position? While SE practitioners tend to ask questions and keep the focus on the interlocutor, there may be a point in the conversation when it is appropriate to share examples (the more personal, the better) that clearly demonstrate the benefits of relinquishing certainty.</p>\n\n<p>While I don’t often practice one-on-one, face-to-face SE with strangers, my method of showing the upside of uncertainty comes in the form of teaching critical thinking skills to my students. For example, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNhb-OBLV18\" target=\"_blank\">one of my lectures (“I Can’t Believe I Believed That: Facts &amp; Fallacies in Physics &amp; Astronomy”)</a> features several examples from my own teaching career in which my own certainty led me to teach scientific concepts incompletely and/or incorrectly. That I was “certain” that I was right in what I was teaching prevented me from being the best teacher I could be. I wasn’t deliberately teaching my students things I knew to be wrong, but rather I was teaching them what, at the time, I thought to be “right,” having never attempted to match my level of confidence in my correctness with the methods I had used to arrive at that confidence. In fact, had I not been challenged, I would never have examined those methods or beliefs in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>This goes to show that even someone trained in science and employed as a teacher can fall prey to the siren song of certainty. It is my hope that the critical thinking lectures I deliver to my students teach them that being open to uncertainty, while sometimes uncomfortable, is a path more likely to bend toward truth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the interest of acknowledging my own biases, I admit a comfort level with uncertainty. Before my current teaching job, I worked for a decade as a professional meteorologist – six years as a TV weatherman. When was the last time you saw 100% chance of rain/snow show up on a 7-day forecast? How long would a meteorologist remain employed with an “absolutely no doubt / there’s-no-way-I-could-be-mistaken” level of certainty? My job had probability built into it and my viewers, explicitly or implicitly, understood that -- just as I understood that probability was inherent in the computer models from which I was developing my forecast. Perhaps this is why I find SE, and its emphasis on probability and percentages, so appealing.</p>\n\n<p>Contrast that with my current situation. I live and teach in the Bible Belt South. In a few short weeks when Lent draws to a close, “He is Risen” will be emblazoned on every church’s sign and trumpeted from every pulpit. For many people who live in my community, this is a foundational truth – they are as 100% as Hafsa was about the identity of her biological mother.</p>\n\n<p>At the risk of a “spoiler” (you really should watch the video in its entirety), Hafsa moved from her 100% position by the end of the SE conversation. She didn’t abandon the belief entirely, but the SE conversation helped to more accurately match her level of confidence to the reliability of her methods. Wouldn’t it be nice if, driving around my town on Easter Sunday morning, I saw a “60% chance that He is Risen” on a church sign?</p>\n\n<p>So my plan is to give up certainty, and not just for Lent. Every day should be an opportunity to scrutinize something that I would never have had reason to previously question.

Not just any Southern Baptist church, but a small church planted firmly in the then relatively rural American South.\n\n</p><p>\nEvery Sunday morning for as long as I can remember, I’d rise from my slumber, make my way downstairs in my pajamas to my Mom’s breakfast of cream of wheat, and tune in to a syndicated episode of “Lost in Space” on our tiny, black-and-white kitchen TV.  Then I would head back upstairs for a quick transformation into semi-formal Sunday clothes – which basically meant an outfit that landed somewhere between school clothes and a suit with a clip-on tie. I would then bid adieu to the Robinsons and the Robot, and, with my little King James Bible in hand, be whisked off to Sunday school.\n\n</p><p>\nI have fond memories of that church. Memories of me waiting for my parents to arrive for the main Sunday service, sitting alone in the pews after attending my Sunday school class. This was what one might call an old-time Southern Baptist church full of old-time religion. Old songs were sung from old hymnals by an old choir and to a fairly old congregation.  We sang “How Great Thou Art,”  “Old-Time Religion,”  “Nothing but the Blood of Jesus,” and of course, “Amazing Grace.”  The pulpit was book-ended by an organist and a pianist and the preacher would always start low and end high with the zeal one would expect from a preacher with some of that old-time religion! For better or worse, whether it was that this church was only a few miles from where I grew up or whether it was some “spiritual” connection my parents felt, this was our church.\n\n</p><p>\nI had ridden the peaks and valleys of weekly salvation and damnation for years. The whole emotional enterprise seemed to be going along just fine, but then something interesting happened. One Sunday when I was around twelve years old, I was given a Xerox copy of a list of bands and songs that I was, from that point forward, to consider as “devil” music. Yes, devil music. According to my church, listening to Led Zeppelin's “Stairway to Heaven” was blasphemy. Anything by Black Sabbath was a one-way ticket to hell. Even Gary Wright's “Dream Weaver” meant that I was astral projecting and thus opening a door for The Enemy! As a child of the seventies, I had been jamming to this music for nearly as long as I could remember. I had a KISS t-shirt when I was in the first grade for crying out loud! I adored most of the music on this sheet. It didn’t make any sense. My young brain was set into analytical motion. I thought the whole thing was preposterous. I was not worshipping the devil. Regardless, getting this message from my quaint, bucolic church was a shock to my pious young system.\n\n</p><p>\nLooking back, it was around that time that I really started questioning the validity of what people in authority were telling me. I began comparing claims that did not rely on evidence with those that did. I was told that Adam and Eve and Noah’s Ark were true stories, yet I watched documentaries about Lucy the Australopithecus afarensis on PBS’ <i>Nature</i>. I was told that my god created the universe, the Earth, and all its inhabitants in six literal days, yet I watched Carl Sagan explain the evidence for Big Bang cosmology on <i>Cosmos</i>. I began to compare each claim I was told to believe without question to what could be supported using reason and evidence. I no longer relied on the earnestness or the authority of the person doing the telling; I wanted proof!\n\n</p><p>\nFast-forward to today, and it occurs to me that I have promoted critical thinking by valuing reason and evidence my entire adult life. I have argued, debated, chatted, typed, tweeted, and talked about a whole host of beliefs that people maintain based on unreliable methods. Invariably, at the conclusion of many of these discussions, just when I thought I had hit a logic home run or a made an evidence slam dunk, my interlocutor would leave the conversation with even more resolve. But why? \n\n</p><p>\nIf you are reading this on the Street Epistemology blog then of course you already know why. \n\n</p><p>\nFor years, I had been supporting my positions using reason and evidence, but I was missing the greater contextual picture: epistemology. I remember listening to a Dr. Peter Boghossian lecture on YouTube several years ago where he explained his idea of conducting a sort of “street epistemology.” I was gobsmacked. All these years I had been trying to convince people that their claims were untrue by using methods that would have worked perfectly well on me. I was using reason and evidence on people who had formed beliefs based on something other than reason and evidence! Hence, the outcome was often an impasse, or worse, a doubling down on the mistaken belief. I now know that I was practically cultivating the backfire effect! I am reminded of the famous Thomas Paine quote from <i>The American Crises</i>:\n\n</p><p>\n</p><blockquote>\n“To argue with a man who has renounced the use and authority of reason, and whose philosophy consists in holding humanity in contempt, is like administering medicine to the dead, or endeavoring to convert an atheist by scripture. Enjoy, sir, your insensibility of feeling and reflecting. It is the prerogative of animals.”\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThomas Paine needed some Street Epistemology! But I can appreciate Paine’s frustration. Decoupling people from beliefs not grounded in reality is not a binary exercise. It’s farming, not hunting. It takes time. It takes patience. I believe it takes practice. I have been deploying the techniques more and more frequently when speaking with people on a whole range of beliefs that do not comport with reality, and I am seeing hints of success.\n\n</p><p>\nFrom global warming deniers to people who believe demons are real, I am now trying to resist the old urge to ridicule as a means of retort and I am even trying to resist my knee-jerk reliance on evidence as the tool that might convince them they are wrong (see Paine above). I am now trying to help people recognize their own epistemic deficiencies. I want them to poke their own holes in the methods they are relying upon for determining what they believe is true. They have to change their own minds. I’m now simply helping them clear the path. I have already noticed an improvement in results.\n\n</p><p>\nFor example, in a recent Facebook exchange about politics (among the most futile activities one can imagine), and specifically, a conversation about how Donald Trump continues to make claims that are untrue, I was able to deploy a little Socratic SE to help my interlocutor understand the double standard with which he was excusing Trump’s lies. The exchange went something like this. Trump had just tweeted something that was demonstrably untrue.\n\n</p><p>\nMe: “Why do you think Trump would tweet something that's just incorrect?”<br>\nIL: “Because he is frustrated because the Dems are using childish tactics to hold up the government because they lost an election and lost seats.”<br>\nMe: “Does that mean it's OK to lie?”<br>\nIL: “You mean like every politician?”<br>\nMe: “So if I understand you correctly, you’re actually OK with politicians lying because you expect that from them? I don’t recall you making that same excuse for Hillary Clinton.”\n\n</p><p>\nMy interlocutor disengaged and I did not press. I was not going to change his mind at that moment, but I was hopeful that I had done enough to cause him to reevaluate his own partisan bias. A few days later, he was actually posting criticisms of Donald Trump! I am not sure if I planted the seed of doubt that took root and sprouted into a single sprig of some healthy skepticism, or if it was something else, but I was again gobsmacked given my interlocutor’s history of doubling down on his partisanship. \n\n</p><p>\nInterventions on Facebook, while accessible, may not be the most effective. That said, we are all learning as we go. If we can continue to plant seeds of good epistemology, no matter the medium and no matter the conversation, we can make progress. My next goal is to have a face-to-face conversation with a complete stranger. We should all set our own stretch goals that push us to extend critical thinking to those around us. It takes practice. \n\n</p><p>\nFundamentally, I am looking forward to deploying Street Epistemology in conversations anywhere and everywhere, whenever I hear claims being made that are not supported by evidence. \n\n</p><p>\nThe journey, and hopefully the gobsmacking, continues!\n\n</p><p>\n-Ryan \n\n</p><p>\nRyan Bays is a writer, Dungeon Master, free-thinker, truth seeker, and unabashed promoter of critical thinking and scientific literacy.\n\n</p><p>\nSubscribe to his YouTube channel here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCENkdsCZsCft2occKqlWjXA\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCENkdsCZsCft2occKqlWjXA</a>\n\n</p><p>\nFollow him on:\n\n</p><p>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RLBays\">https://twitter.com/RLBays</a><br>\nFacebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RLBays\">https://www.facebook.com/RLBays</a><br>\nInstagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ryan_bays/\">https://www.instagram.com/ryan_bays/</a><br>\nHis blog: <a href=\"https://ryanbays.com/\">https://ryanbays.com/</a><br>\n\n</p><p>\n\n\t\t</p>",

We can expect a handful of decades at most, and that amount can be reduced or expire completely without notice. Shouldn't we all be spending every hour of our time in this world wisely and carefully?</p>\n\n<p>Street Epistemologists seem to have an attraction to engaging with the \"tough nuts,” such as experienced apologists, those with a large following and social media presence, and other such figures. These people are unlikely to respond to Street Epistemology. The appeal of wanting to see if Street Epistemology can affect people like this is understandable, but is it really the best use of our time? Perhaps it's the thrill of the challenge, a grudge against the tough nut's particular religion, or perhaps retribution for having believed something similar. But wouldn't it make more sense to ignore the tough nuts and instead always go for the low-hanging fruit?&nbsp; For example, college students seem to be ideal interlocutors. They are usually legal adults, but not so old that they have become too invested in a single set of beliefs. College is a highly social environment that encourages exploration, challenging ideas, and learning new things - almost ideal for street epistemology. In other words, college students are the exact opposite of the tough nuts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Here is another suggestion: When a Street Epistemologist has engaged someone and it becomes clear that the person is not able or willing to entertain hypotheticals such as \"If that were to happen, how would it affect your confidence?\", or present their position in plain terms, consider wrapping up the talk and moving on, as the likelihood of making progress is remote.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We know that many of the tough nuts out there are really on a mission of their own: they're looking to hone their own arguments and see Street Epistemology as a challenge that must be defeated. They're often looking to boost their followings and are not really interested in engaging in actual dialogue examining their epistemology. There's nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't serve the purposes of Street Epistemology. So why help them if it doesn't help us? &nbsp;Why invest a lot of time and effort for no impact?</p>\n\n<p>In short, if our goal is to help people live lives less hindered by weakly-justified beliefs through Street Epistemology, we should be using a strategy that has the greatest effect with the smallest investment of our valuable time. If it is clear that an interlocutor is not engaging in good faith, doesn't it make sense to spend our time elsewhere?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

However, out of concern that my wife might simply read the title and misconstrue my goals in asking her questions about her belief in god, as well as her request that I respect her belief, I had been hiding the book for some time for fear of my wife’s reaction. Well, one evening, I slipped up and left it lying out. Understandably, my wife, upon finding the book, was quite upset and was convinced after reading the title and some of the chapter headings that I was disingenuous and I was actually seeking to de-convert her from her faith. She had become convinced that I was not merely a seeker of truth, but that I was secretly plotting to proselytize for atheism.\n\n</p><p>\nAfter giving my wife some time to cool down, I tried to assure her that the goal of Street Epistemology is not to “create atheists.” Rather, it aims to help people see where they are using unreliable paths to truth, then lead them to instead embrace good epistemology: logic, reason, evidence, and critical thought. The title itself, <i>A Manual for Creating Atheists</i>, as well as Dr Boghossian’s metaphors such as “the faith virus” and “removing the disease of faith” can certainly be off-putting and unnecessarily confrontational.  The title is based on the idea that when people start using reliable epistemology instead of unreliable epistemology, that <i>should</i> result in atheism, absent other factors motivating them to hold on to belief. So, someone who thinks good epistemology leads one to God should be unconcerned. Understandably, though, as she feels her Christianity is a core part of her identity, she was put off by the title and the chapter headers. Combining all this with the fact I was hiding the book from her, it’s easy to see how this could make her feel betrayed and upset. At this point, I was in an emotional panic. Would my wife leave me and take the kids? Would she denounce me and out me to other friends and family as an atheist, as I am out to her but not to most of my family and friends? \n\n</p><p>\nThankfully, I was able to shelve those thoughts. But first, I had to de-escalate the situation before I could make my case. Firstly, I reflected her feelings by paraphrasing her concerns back to her. I said, “So, after seeing this book, you now feel that my goal is to create more atheists, correct?” Secondly, I showed that I appreciated her voicing those concerns to me: “I’m glad you shared this with me and I appreciate your willingness to talk through this.” Thirdly, I empathized with her: “I imagine you must feel betrayed, as I initially felt when I saw Leslie Strobel’s book, <i>Surviving a Spiritual Mismatch in Marriage</i>, on your e-reader.”\n\n</p><p>\nThen, I began to calmly discuss the topic with her, using some of the tools I had learned by watching various Street Epistemology videos. I asked her, “If my goal was to simply proselytize and create atheists, would I have been willing to pray for knowledge of God and then proceed to read the Gospel of John as my former teacher suggested I do? No, I would not have done that as a sign of good intentions and modeling openness.” She then conceded that no, I would not have done so. Then, I reaffirmed to her that my goal is to live an honest, truthful life, and that in order to do so, I had to examine whether my method for determining truth was reliable and sound. We went on to have a heartfelt discussion and amicably agreed to respect each other, despite our differences in religious views. As a demonstration of good intention, I agreed to pause my reading of this book and start reading a book about parenting an autistic child, for our daughter’s sake, since my wife made a fair point that her diagnosis is a more pressing concern at present. I did, however, gently remind her that I am open to the possibility I am wrong, and I am willing to have my beliefs unpacked and discussed using Street Epistemology.\n\n</p><p>\nI would love to, as an aside, point out how supportive the Street Epistemology Private Study Group on Facebook was for me in this situation. This experience helped convince me that sharing it with the group was the right decision, as the outpouring of response and empathy was refreshing. The comments and feedback I received indicated that I had made a good decision in sharing my experience with the group. To all who took the time to support me and give feedback there: thank you.\n\n</p><p>\nIn retrospect, I’ll close in true Street Epistemology style with a series of questions: Did my wife feel hurt to discover I'd been hiding the book? Yes. Was it uncomfortable to defend such a provocative book title as <i>A Manual for Creating Atheists</i>? Yes. Was it a beneficial exercise that increased my empathy and understanding, as well as stressed the importance of being forthright, open, honest and genuine? Absolutely. \n\n</p><p>\n</p><hr>\n<p>\n<i>Veridor is a network engineer, a skeptic, and a free-thinker who tries to model doxastic openness and embracing the null hypothesis.

While followers of mainstream faiths can be very closed in their beliefs, we don't necessarily consider them victims, but followers. Those trapped in cults are, however, under constant and intense indoctrination, often from birth, and so we have no hesitation in calling them victims.</p>\n\n<p>One organisation that has many characteristics of a cult is the Jehovah’s Witnesses (JWs), also known as the Watchtower Society (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Jehovah%27s_Witnesses#See_also\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a>). While JWs are well known for their door-to-door proselytizing, and more recently “cart witnessing”, the general public knows very little about the inner workings of the Watchtower Society and the level of control it has over its members. The slightest suspicion of a critical word against their organisation can automatically trigger an inner defense mechanism that slams the shutters down on the conversation. This can make engaging in Street Epistemology with Jehovah’s Witnesses a daunting task. Even Dr. Peter Boghossian has stated that JWs are the most difficult challenge for producing glimmers of doxastic openness. So, how can we penetrate far enough to provoke thought without springing the interlocutor’s fight/flight reflex?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Addressing the challenge</h2>\n\n<p>When engaging in SE with JWs, focus on cordiality and curiosity. In fact, we advise speaking as if completely ignorant of all things related to JW, while presenting a child-like curiosity. This approach is strongly recommended by ex-JW and SE enthusiast Kyle Bouchard. Kyle was indoctrinated into the organisation from birth, but managed to deprogram himself in his mid twenties through a love of science and a critical study of the Bible without church supervision. “I cannot stress enough the importance of playing the fool. JWs are conditioned to distrust anyone who comes across as intelligent or educated, or anyone who might suggest they re-examine their beliefs. They are required to limit their interactions with non-members as much as possible, and while witnessing, will only interact with a ‘worldly’ person (anyone not in the organisation) if they deem there’s a chance that they can be recruited.”</p>\n\n<p>Let’s suppose one of us spots a JW cart on the street. With the same curiosity that prompts me to ask for a magazine, I open a conversation, aiming for 15-20 minutes maximum. I say that I'm not strongly committed to any particular set of beliefs but am interested in finding out how others have done so. I introduce myself and establish where they are on the 0-100 scale, invariably 100. I mention how believers in different faith traditions are also strongly convinced by their particular scriptures and gods. When pressed on this point, the IL may respond that ‘We don’t judge the beliefs of others’. I may reply, ‘I’m not suggesting you should judge. I just wondered how you account for so many different convictions. What convinced you to become a Witness?’ Hopefully, their answer contains a reference to living by the (true) principles of the bible or that they believe the Witness (Watchtower) interpretation of scripture is the true one.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>The light gets brighter</h2>\n\n<p>Now I focus on separating their adherence to Watchtower teachings about scripture from scripture itself. These start out inextricably bound in the IL’s mind but the doctrine of the ‘new light’ can help untangle them. Watchtower uses the terms ‘new light’ or ‘the light getting brighter’ to justify revisions or changes to official dogma, and most importantly, failed prophesies, of which there have been many. I prompt the IL to open up regarding ‘new light’ by asking, ‘If any new information <em>came to light</em> regarding a particular teaching, and that teaching was revised, would you be prepared to accept the revision or would you stick to the original teaching?’ I may get an obfuscation, a Yes, or No or, ‘It depends on the teaching’.</p>\n\n<p>If Yes, I reply: ‘That’s great. Wouldn’t it be more accurate to move a little further down on the confidence scale in order to accommodate further revisions?’ I find this a difficult point to get across, but press the idea that one can’t hold absolute certainty in the current teachings if those teachings are subject to revision. The specific goal here is to get them to move off 100% certainty in the current teachings.</p>\n\n<p>If No, I reply: ‘So you wouldn’t accept the revision, even if the vast majority of your fellow Witnesses went along with it. Wouldn’t that mean you were distancing yourself from Witness teachings?’, or ‘Do you feel the people who formulate the teachings have a reliable way of interpreting scripture?’</p>\n\n<p>If ‘It depends on the teaching’, I may take a chance and pinpoint an example of Watchtower policy based, not explicitly stated in scripture, such as refusing blood transfusions or military service. I go with blood transfusions as it's a sensitive subject, it makes JWs stand out from other Christian groups, and Watchtower has been quietly revising its stance on transfusions; perhaps with a view to scrapping the prohibition altogether.</p>\n\n<p>SE: 'Oh, is it you guys who don’t have blood transfusions?’<br>\nIL: ‘Yes. It’s forbidden in scripture.’<br>\nSE: ‘That’s the Witness teaching?’<br>\nIL: ‘Yes’.<br>\nSE: ‘If there was new light shed on that scripture, and the teaching was changed so that it was now okay for Witnesses to receive blood transfusions, would you be prepared to accept that?’</p>\n\n<p>Barring obfuscation or a refusal to answer, the reply should be a Yes or No.</p>\n\n<p>IL: ‘Yes.’<br>\nSE: ‘Wouldn’t that suggest the current teaching on blood transfusions is wrong?’</p>\n\n<p>Or</p>\n\n<p>IL: ‘No.’<br>\nSE: ‘So, you’d regard that revision as a false teaching?’</p>\n\n<p>I'm encouraging the IL to consider the reliability of the process used by those at the top of the organisation in dictating what can and can’t be believed. I've had more success imparting doubt about the human component of revealing ‘The Truth’ than in questioning the Bible itself. Many accounts by ex-Witnesses say they began to doubt because of teachings they couldn’t reconcile with their own reason or personal understanding of scripture.</p>\n\n<p>I'm likely to hear in response that the (exclusively male) humans comprising the Governing Body are directed by the Holy Spirit, which can lead to a tangle, but I counter with the Outsider Test for Faith: ‘There are so many people who claim the Holy Spirit guides them to beliefs that differ from yours. Can’t the guidance of the Spirit be interpreted in different ways?’</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Example 1, Clip 1</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5twWrGdcMj5Y1dIS2R6U3J5Z2s/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5twWrGdcMj5Y1dIS2R6U3J5Z2s/view?usp=sharing</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Example 1, Clip 2</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5twWrGdcMj5T2I5VEFueDR2bGs/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5twWrGdcMj5T2I5VEFueDR2bGs/view?usp=sharing</a></p>\n\n<p>Consider the above excerpts from a conversation between myself and a JW husband and wife team manning a cart in central London. I recorded this before I'd fully thought out this approach, but you can hear that they’re encouraged to focus on the importance of belief revision in the light of new information. In the second clip, Stephen opens up about the ‘new light’ concept and even volunteers the idea that Watchtower has made revisions in the past due to mistakes in interpretation. As a result, he and his wife seem to accept the idea of dropping to 99% to accommodate changes at the end.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Example 2, Clip 3</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5twWrGdcMj5djJnS1cyNVFCYVE/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5twWrGdcMj5djJnS1cyNVFCYVE/view?usp=sharing</a></p>\n\n<p>This is the first conversation I struck up with the intent of using the ‘new light’ strategy. The interlocutors didn't volunteer the expression, but I managed to bring the idea of changeable JW teachings to the fore after around five minutes. Though quite evasive, both ladies admitted doctrine had been changed in the past and claimed there was no way they would accept Watchtower lifting the ban on blood transfusions, a hallmark belief. I took the opportunity to press them on discrepancies between their personal understanding of scripture and what is taught by the Organisation. One IL also mentioned how the attitude towards Christmas changed in the 1920s, but we didn't go into detail.</p>\n\n<p>I've linked to further audio samples at the end. While many Witnesses eschew any possibility of revising beliefs, others are more pensive.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n\n<p>I hope we have provided some direction for engaging JWs. Our goal is to provoke reflection on strongly-held beliefs to plant a seed of doubt. With JWs we consider it a success if the IL moves down from 100% confidence in the truth of current Witness teaching, after accepting the contradiction between being absolutely certain, while claiming to be open to accepting revisions.</p>\n\n<p>Remember to maintain the cordiality and curiosity all the way through. Also to 'play the fool' and use generic language about religious beliefs, avoiding JW terminology such as 'Watchtower', 'Governing Body', 'Kingdom Hall', 'Pioneer', 'Publisher', 'Elder' etc. Be aware of how discomforted the interlocutor is in deciding how far you can go in pressing the ‘new light’ intervention strategy. As you develop experience you can become more adept at delivering a seed of doubt before the lockdown reflex can kick in.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Links</h2>\n\n<p>For more of David Hancock’s interventions with Witnesses, go to:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5twWrGdcMj5LVdzSjU5Y1k0NDQ?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5twWrGdcMj5LVdzSjU5Y1k0NDQ?usp=sharing</a></p>\n\n<p>To learn about JW beliefs and how they have changed over the decades, go to:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jwfacts.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.jwfacts.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

This provides me with an interesting situation in that I feel compelled to keep my atheism closeted, but at the same time there is a great need in my community for SE and also lots of great opportunities that I’ve been able to capitalize upon.</em>\n\n</p><p>\nI've been to several live talks given by Anthony Magnabosco on the subject of Street Epistemology (SE). He's as calm and gentle in real life as he is on his videos and his talks are thorough and patient as you might expect if you've ever seen his YouTube channel. At the end of his talks he usually opens the floor to some Q&amp;A and a common audience reaction has been a suggestion that SE is just \"us doing to them what they've always done to us.\" I find this idea rather baffling, but it is common enough that I wanted to address it here.\n\n</p><p>\nLike many of you, I've had to deal with people knocking on my door asking if I've found Jesus. I've seen them standing on street corners screaming through megaphones. I've seen news reports of them protesting funerals. I've had to be at public events and stop what I am doing as I am forced to listen to them broadcast their prayers over the loudspeakers. For so long I've been so tired of being proselytized that I sometimes feel like screaming “I don't want your god! Pray all you want, but stop trying to get me to live under the rules of YOUR imaginary friend!!” \n\n</p><p>\nIt should be obvious that SE is decidedly different from religious proselytizing for a number of reasons. Clearly I am not telling someone what to believe, but rather  just asking questions about how they came to the beliefs they currently hold and helping them establish the reliability of the methods they use. I'm finding truth, not \"sharing\" what I already believe to be the truth. SE is about asking rather than telling. It is about listening rather than talking. And yet, despite the obvious differences I sometimes still don’t feel comfortable initiating SE conversations with others.\n\n</p><p>\nOne misconception I've often heard about SE is that one has to go out and interview strangers on the street in the way so many SE YouTube videos are done. I mean, the term \"Street Epistemology\" literally has \"Street\" in the name. Likewise, the more visible signs of Street Epistemology like the conversations with strangers video recorded and posted to YouTube might indicate that type of interaction as the norm.  However, the most visible examples of interactions between believers and non-believers might not be the most common nor the most effective.\n\n</p><p>\nI see real value in engaging random strangers in short conversations about their deeply held beliefs. And I see the value when those interactions are recorded and analyzed for effectiveness and this value is multiplied every time someone else watches the videos and is able to learn something from them. I am grateful for the videos created and posted by Street Epistemology pioneers like Anthony Magnabosco, Socrates Jones, and others. However, this is not the only way to conduct an SE conversation, and it might not even be the best way, particularly for your temperament and conversation style. So, if you've seen SE videos and thought \"There is no way I'm going to do that\", well, welcome to my club! \n\n</p><p>\nWhen doing Street Epistemology, I converse with others about the methods they used to come to their beliefs. It doesn’t matter who initiates the conversation. If you are comfortable starting the conversation, by all means, go ahead. But you can also conduct SE when believers initiate the conversation. I can tell you that I've been doing SE since shortly after Peter Boghossian released his book <em>A Manual for Creating Atheists</em> and I have never initiated a SE conversation. Every talk I’ve had was initiated by the other party. Oh, they might not have expected to have me ask questions about what they said, but it was THEY who opened the conversation. I’ve never knocked on a door or approached a random stranger to talk about anything SE related. \n\n</p><p>\nWhere I live in the Bible Belt of the deep south, I never have to wait more than a week or two before someone says something to me that is either blatant proselytizing or an attempt to reconfirm that they are surrounded by like-minded people. This might be a request to pray, it could be statement that praises their god for something as simple as a sunset or as personal as their successful bout with cancer. They might ask what church I go to. They might ask if my child is enrolled in church camp or Vacation Bible School. It could even be about something unrelated to religion: a family member about getting her son Ionic Foot Detox Therapy twice a week, or an email about wanting to share a Groupon for an acupuncture session. When these conversations are started, I can seamlessly, graciously, and politely begin the SE process on THEIR terms.\n\n</p><p>\nAnd of course, you can always decide later to strap on a video camera and take to the parks to engage the faithful. But you shouldn't ever feel pressure to do so. It’s just as effective to do Street Epistemology only when the opportunity arises in the course of your daily life.\n\n</p><p>\n\n\t\t</p>",

Looks like somebody over   there is reading the Bible, and I'm going to try to start using my Boghossian Street Epistemology techniques. [I'm a] self-admitted novice here—never really done this before—but I'm going to try my best to start employing the techniques that I've learned from reading Peter's book, and hopefully get better from there.\" <p style=\"text-align:right;\">—December 28, 2013 ( <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8Ptr8GCT6d0\">Video</a> )\n</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>\n</p><h2>Background</h2>\n<p>\nI had just finished reading Boghossian’s book, <i>‘A Manual for Creating Atheists’</i> and was heading out to engage the faithful for the first time when I recorded those words. Aside from a handful of short scenarios in Boghossian’s book and a fledgling group of early adopters sharing their experiences in the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/streetepistemology/\">Private Street Epistemology Facebook</a> Group, there were no audio or video examples of people using Street Epistemology (SE) to learn from at the time. Nothing!\n\n</p><p>\nNot to be deterred, I started engaging with believers using my best understanding of SE. Many of these encounters were filmed and uploaded to my YouTube channel, which is nearing 2 million video views as I write this post. I didn’t realize it until just recently, but the constant feedback I received over the years—from casual viewers, to people well-versed in SE, to Dr. Peter Boghossian himself—were slowly shaping my approach into what you see today. \n\n</p><p>\n<em>Sidenote: Although this was a journey that took me three years to reach, I still feel like there is room for drastic improvement going forward. I’m nowhere close to being done working at this!</em>\n\n</p><p>\nBecause I had saturated YouTube with my personal examples, and because there weren’t a whole lot of other alternatives, many people (critics and supporters) walked away with the impression that SE could/should be performed one way: Magnabosco-style.\n\n</p><p>\nI <em>never</em> formed a conscious goal to build (what some people have dubbed) a “script” to be blindly copied by the masses. My goals were pretty simple, perhaps even selfish: How could I get faster and more effective at SE in order to reduce video durations and help popularize this method for viewers who likely won’t sit through an hour-long video?\n\n</p><p>\nIf you talk to enough people with the goal of becoming proficient at Street Epistemology, more than likely you, too, will notice that your talks (regardless of your interlocutors’ religious affiliations) may appear to observers to follow some sort of unflinching flowchart.\n\n</p><p>\nToday, I have mixed feelings about the perception that there is a Street Epistemology “script.” Let me explain.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Pitching (Promoting) the “Script”</h2>\n<p>\nOn one hand, I can see how beneficial having examples must be to someone new to SE; I craved samples to study before creating some myself.  Being better prepared for conversations with a believer, regardless of their claim, can be extremely advantageous and potentially calming for someone new to Street Epistemology.\n\n</p><p>\nI also suspect that many people may have never felt comfortable or prepared enough to have a conversation with someone in the first place unless they had familiarized themselves with a few video examples beforehand. Having a rough idea of where a conversation might head in advance could provide people with that extra bit of reassurance needed to inspire them to continue on with the discussion. A discussion that could very well end up benefiting everyone involved.\n\n</p><p>\nPeople regularly contact me to say that when they used SE for their very first time, they helped someone else honestly examine the epistemology of their belief, often with incredible outcomes. A self-reported lowering of confidence in a belief. Abandoning behaviors that were not concordant with reality. A willingness to examine other beliefs they held to the same scrutiny.\n\n</p><p>\nThese people usually go on to say that watching SE videos helped prepare them for the discussion. Reports of this alone cause me to think twice about discounting the “script.”\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Pitching (Discarding) the “Script”</h2>\n<p>\nThe biggest concern I have when people appear to be following the “script” during a conversation is the perception—usually from outside observers and not the actual participants—that the person conducting SE is detached and disingenuous. This can be particularly difficult to dispute when a person mimics entire phrases or exclamations of surprise they may have copied from watching elsewhere (e.g., “You’re 100% confident? Wow!”).\n\n</p><p>\n“How can you claim to be open and objective if you are not being sincere and authentic yourself?” is a valid criticism. While it appears helpful to rely on conversations for guidance and confidence, it is imperative that you develop your own style. As Peter Boghossian said <a href=\"https://streetepistemology.com/publications/street_epistemology_is_open_source\">recently</a>,\n\n</p><p>\n</p><blockquote>\n“These are your conversations. Your friends. And helping people in your life to be more reflective, honest, and less dogmatic about their beliefs demands that you use your voice in those conversations. Not mine. Not someone else’s. Yours.”\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThat’s solid advice. Try your best to bring your own ideas, personality, and experiences to your conversations. Be yourself. Tell a personal story that helps show why these talks matter to you.\n\n</p><p>\nThere’s also nothing wrong with admitting that you are using Street Epistemology during your conversations. There’s nothing to hide, because the method is friendly, sincere, respectful, thought-provoking, and potentially change-inducing. Something simple like, “Hey, can we shift gears a bit here? I’d like to ask you some questions that I’ve heard from people who are using this thing called ‘Street Epistemology. What do you think?” \n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Going Forward</h2>\n<p>\nThe conversations one might watch on my YouTube channel today are the result of hundreds that preceded them, and have been shaped by thousands of (solicited and unsolicited!) suggestions from people over the years. It would be short-sighted if we did not try to learn how to get better at SE by studying these examples, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh10RgQgGuM_R-Qe34sq3t2qjdsL2sb_c\">and the examples of others</a> closely.\n\n</p><p>\nBut it is also very important that we don’t just stop there.\n\n</p><p>\nIncorporate something unique about yourself into each of your talks. Make a note of what was effective and what set your talks back. Practice. And finally, please share your successes and failures with me and the <a href=\"https://streetepistemology.com/the-10000/\">thousands of other people</a>  who are learning Street Epistemology so we can all continuously work to improve this important approach that appears to be helping people re-examine their deeply-held beliefs across the world.\n\n</p><p>\n\n\t\t</p>",

You playing 20 questions?\n</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThe “Why-Because-Why” back and forth is not a sustainable conversation dynamic. Just imagine yourself being asked a series of why questions. You’re giving explanation after explanation, and you’re feeling a bit proud that you’re so prepared, but every time you explain yourself, instead of acknowledging your <em>pretty darn good answer</em> (if I say so myself), their immediate response is another “Why?” question. I’ve been through this, and am familiar with the growing sense of social imbalance as they question me, and the growing pressure to re-assert myself as an equal partner in the conversation. Who does this person think they are treating me like this, an interrogator?  That’s not how we want the IL to feel.\n\n</p><p>\n\tWhile I’ve lived through that dynamic numerous times in the course of my life, I only just recently noticed my tendency to act the part of the interrogator, and learned to correct it (thank you SE). I say I noticed it, but I can’t claim it was especially perceptive of me, considering that my IL’s asked me if I was playing 20 Questions.\n\n</p><p>\n\tIn SE, we do <em>not</em> just question. SE is <em>not</em> about questions. Please rise, brothers and sisters, and join me in a solemn moment of silence for the death of question-after-question-after-question-after-question.\n\n</p><p>\n\tSE is about question <em>and feedback</em>. Question and Feedback, QAF. Observe the difference:\n\n</p><p>\n</p><blockquote>\nSE: Why do you believe in this God?\n\n<p>\nIL: Because I have felt the warmth of His presence.\n\n</p><p>\nSE: So you had this experience...it felt warm and positive, and it seemed to you that God was there with you, or was causing the warmth?\n\n</p><p>\nIL: That’s right. (!!!)\n\n</p><p>\nSE: Okay (pause, like Anthony Magnabosco). How did you know that the warmth was being caused by the God?\n\n</p><p>\nIL: Good question...\n</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>\n<br>\n</p><center>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/oh-yeah.jpg\" width=\"150\">\n  <figcaption>oh yeah :)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</center>\n\n<p>\nThis is QAF in action. You ask a question, and then feed back the answer they give you. If you get it right, you get a “That’s right” in return. If you get it wrong, glory glory hallelujah, it’s a good thing you asked, all is not lost. Clarify their answer until they tell you “That’s right” and then you’re <em>golden</em>.\n\n</p><p>\nCheck out Chris the Hostage Negotiation Expert’s wisdom <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://observer.com/2016/05/this-is-how-to-be-persuasive-7-new-secrets-from-hostage-negotiation/\">here</a>:\n\n</p><p>\n</p><blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\" That’s a really powerful connection to be able to establish. They’re telling you they feel connected to you, and they feel a great rapport with you. If there’s anything that’s going to move them in your direction swiftly it’s when they say, 'That’s right.' \"\n\n</p><p>\n<span style=\"font-style: normal;\">What conversational move is most likely to trigger a “That’s right”?   A summary. Paraphrase back to them what they’ve been saying.</span>\n\n</p><p>\n</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>\nQuestion and Feedback, there it is. Yes, I admit it, I’m not original. I’ve become a “That’s right”-digger only by emulating this great master. But let me add my own experience here. I’ve started to notice a pattern in my conversations. I’ll be asking these “Why?” questions...my IL will be answering...The IL is <em>still</em> not really getting to the root of their chain of justifications, and I’m trying to work down to the true hinge of their belief as fast as possible. I start to ask yet <em>another</em> “Why?” question, and I feel a vague sense of social unease.\n\n</p><p>\nStop (<em>warning, Will Robinson!</em>). I’ve been here before, haven’t I? I know this; I know what happens here. My social instincts are warning me in advance that whatever I’m about to do, for one reason or another, something’s <em>wrong</em> with it. A few times, I noticed that feeling, I thought for a second about what to do about it. Nothing came to mind, so I shrugged and told myself “Hey, it’s a perfectly reasonable question” and soldiered on. <em>Sigh...</em>\n\n</p><p>\nSurprise! They were put off. I lost a few IL’s this way. Now I do a bit better. I notice that feeling of unease, the <em>warning</em>, the one that real interrogators, I do not doubt, have to get used to, and I let it guide me away from interrogator danger. Now, when I feel that a “Why?” question will not be well-received, I deftly swap in a Feedback. I feedback and feedback and feedback until I get a “That’s right” back. Truly, then it is that with glory beaming in my heart, I do continue forward with another “Why?” or “How?” question.\n\n</p><p>\nBut we have not only this master’s mystic wisdom and my own experience to testify to the magic of this technique. That curiously concrete magic unique to computers lends a word of recommendation to the technique. The <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.filfre.net/2011/06/eliza-part-3/\">Eliza Effect</a></em>, named for a computer therapist “Eliza,” denotes how people would “engag[e] in lengthy heart-to-heart’s” with the computer. Her secret? Simple “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://evolutioncounseling.com/mirroring/\">mirroring</a>,” in which 'patients' feelings are reflected back to them by the therapist, who very often <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ronaldjaydavidsonmd.com/Pages/ArePsychotherapistsObsolete.aspx\">rephrases and repeats</a> what the patient has said.”\n\n</p><p>\nThere you have it, ladies and gentlemen. QAF, Question and Feedback. SE’s grand and <em>defining</em> departure from the Socratic Method is that while everyone wanted to kill Socrates after he used it on them, SE enjoys the <em>Eliza Effect</em>, inviting people to openness, honesty, and reflection. I’ve often been a little too Socrates and too little Eliza, and, as you could expect, my IL’s have been a little closer to giving me hemlock than their hearts.\n\n</p><p>\nSo, the next time your IL shows the signs of being too used to being burned to open up and be honest with you (and with themselves) about their epistemology, remember to get a “That’s right” out of them. I sometimes remind myself “IF I sense my IL isn’t going to like another challenging question, THEN I will seek a ‘That’s right’” (see <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/o7c/making_intentions_concrete_triggeraction_planning/\">here</a> for more on this effective way of reminding one’s self to do something at the right time).\n\n</p><p>\nI am Hunter Glenn. Street Epistemology has been a great influence in my life, one of the best. I have a strong interest in improving my own thinking and SE has helped me learn to express in an accessible way many of the lessons I’ve learned from the literature on rationality. I would like to see SE used to guide the world to a way of thinking that will empower us to live better lives together.

I truly appreciated how the methods used in SE are flexible and it really helped my son in his development of critical thinking and scepticism.</p>\n\n<p>Raised in an Anglican church in Yorkshire in the north of England was, for me, mostly a pleasant experience. I still relish the words of the written eucharistic prayer, revel in swimming through the ocean of noise from the church organ and would so happily sit and have a sweet (although inevitably weak) cup of tea with those old ladies and gents whose lives and stories fascinated me.</p>\n\n<p>However.</p>\n\n<p>I have had to spend a lot of effort, time and energy understanding how to question ideas. As a Christian, I would have told you that we were always encouraged to ask questions. As an example, we had a youth Bible study with a nearby church group and the purpose of this was to question everything. But hindsight shows me that the questions we asked, as you would expect, presupposed a God existing and the purpose of the study was to find ways to strengthen our faith and give us the feeling of having our reasons depository filled up.</p>\n\n<p>I am now a married adult with three young boys (9, 4 and 1). I have seen the vast majority of Street Epistemology videos and seek out and admire the work of Anthony Magnabosco and other practitioners. I feel equipped with real tools that affect the way I think about my own thoughts and beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>I was told as a child what to believe and taught it as the truth. I didn’t want to likewise “brainwash” my children, telling them that they should be atheists. For this, I needed instead to provide them with ways to develop their critical thinking skills, to question things in meaningful and effective ways and to look bigger than what’s just in front of them.</p>\n\n<p>But how on Earth are we supposed to go about doing this‽ I still don’t know the answer to this fully, but an opportunity came to go a few metres down this path not so long since.</p>\n\n<p>The week lockdown started in the UK was the week we bought a hot-tub. Coincidence? Yes. A very nice one.</p>\n\n<p>Me and my eldest son, the nine-year-old, were in the hot tub and his two brothers were playing inside. We were having one of those rambling conversations that goes from one thing to another and there’s certainly no way for me now to know how we got onto it, but he simply said “Yeah, but ghosts probably exist.”</p>\n\n<p>Half of my brain yelled “By heck lad – you serious?!” and the other half shouted “This is my opportunity!”. So I asked him what made him think this. He is a bright lad and reads a lot and he was actually quite quickly able to give me some reasons, as though he had been thinking about this before this conversation.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a few (paraphrased):</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Ghosts being incredibly prevalent in literature through history in different places in the world</li>\n\t<li>Reports of haunted buildings or houses</li>\n\t<li>The existence of TV programmes where people hunt ghosts</li>\n\t<li>The fact that the supposed system for how ghosts come into being made sense to him (unfinished business, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I was really pleased that he at least had reasons and for a nine-year-old to have so many thought-through justifications.</p>\n\n<p>I certainly shan’t offer here a play-by-play recount of the conversation, but will give an outline of my main questioning.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>I asked for his reasons.</li>\n\t<li>I asked how confident he was about it – he gave me an 85%.</li>\n\t<li>I asked which was his main reason and whittled it down to his main one – witness testimony.</li>\n\t<li>We explored the scenario but about other supernatural claims, such as the existence of vampires and used his arguments with this example.</li>\n\t<li>If these reasons only give you a 10-20% confidence in the existence of vampires, why do they give him 85% in ghosts?</li>\n\t<li>Ice lolly break – it was proper hot.</li>\n\t<li>He revised his confidence to 50%, but equated this to mean that “there’s a chance they do and a chance they don’t, so that’s 50%”. I explained.</li>\n\t<li>We discussed the concept of falsifiability and he gave me the example of ghosts in his way of explaining falsifiability and the issues here.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>At the end of the conversation, which, granted, was long and deep, he said his brain was like a tangled mop head. I had reached the end of this conversation and perhaps ought to have seen the need to do so sooner. I quickly asked him about his percentage and he said “just under the 50%”. I felt initially downhearted, as I wanted to rapidly get him to a similarly low percentage level as me, however I am reminded of how I know this is potentially an unreasonable wish and how a sudden and confident “Yeah I’m 0% now” might have led me to think he either hadn’t grasped the concepts we were discussing or might have been flippantly throwing out this number with little thought.</p>\n\n<p>However, two or so days later, he came to me after tidying his room and said the following, and again, I paraphrase, but the essence is the same</p>\n\n<p>“Right dad – I’ve been thinking about the ghost stuff we were talking about and I think I’m now at 5-10%. I know that the books and films aren’t good evidence, but they must stand for something, however small.”</p>\n\n<p>I adore my son and this conversation was just great. He was eager to embrace the topic and I was able to discuss this more in future discussions. I loved how he kept stopping during the discussion to consider questions asked or to find ways to clarify or vocalise his own thoughts. I was really pleased with how he seemed to enjoy these conversations and how he likewise enjoyed being challenged on his ideas. Analogies to equivalent topics was an incredibly useful tool.</p>\n\n<p>I hope to be able to have similar discussions in future about this and other topics and I think he would enjoy doing so. His younger brothers have lots of fun awaiting them in a few years!</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p><em>Hi - I'm Richard, the Yorkshire Atheist; I used to be a Christian, but as my name suggests, no more!

So how can we learn SE and at the same time get feedback from other aspiring epistemologists in order to improve our skills and use them in our everyday life to the greatest extent possible? Start a local SE club, of course! And that's exactly what we did in Moscow, Russia, in May 2017.</p>\n\n<p>The following describes the set structure of our weekly meetings and the work that occurs behind the scenes, with the main intention of inspiring the birth of new SE learning clubs around the world. It goes without saying that our particular structure is not the only one possible, and may very well not be the optimal one. And yet the one we have for the moment has gradually taken shape over the months, and it works pretty well for us and our visitors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Part 1. The Meetings</h2>\n\n<h3>Start by introducing ourselves</h3>\n\n<p>Of course we don't do that if there are no newcomers present, but there almost always are. So we say our names and why we do SE in a couple of words. This should take less than a minute for each person.</p>\n\n<h3>Divide into groups</h3>\n\n<p>We divide into two or more groups, one of which is for people who are new to SE. An experienced member gives an introductory speech about SE to the newcomers, answers their questions and maybe even offers to conduct a demonstration.</p>\n\n<h3>Specialised exercises</h3>\n\n<p>People already familiar with the method usually practice SE by conducting dialogues with each other or participating in exercises to improve a specific aspect of their SE skill. An experienced moderator is usually needed. Here are a few examples of possible exercises:</p>\n\n<p>- Practice asking specific \"How\" questions, assuming we already know the belief of an IL, her level of confidence, and her reasons for that.</p>\n\n<p>- &nbsp;Responding to different interlocutor behavior. The moderator can adopt the interlocutor role. For example being in a hurry, or being too emotional, or talking too much, or frequently changing subject.</p>\n\n<p>- How to respond to an interlocutor who gives a lot of different potential topics to discuss, and how to decide which topic of hers is most desirable for conducting an SE dialogue.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, usually about an hour later, we take our first break, and after that we can mix the newcomers with everyone else.</p>\n\n<h3>Role-play SE dialogues</h3>\n\n<p>This is probably our main activity. We assign an epistemologist and an interlocutor, and we also assign at least one official observer of the talk - preferably one who knows SE rather well - to give feedback to an epistemologist after the dialogue. Many of the other attendees will also observe the interaction. We time the dialogue (usually no more than 10 minutes), the feedback, and the subsequent discussion (usually no more than another 5 minutes). After the dialogue the following happens:</p>\n\n<p>- First, the person playing the epistemologist tries to pass The Ideological Turing Test, explaining in their own words what the interlocutor believes and why. The interlocutor gives feedback on their accuracy.</p>\n\n<p>- Second, the assigned observer gives feedback. This feedback has two aspects: one is about the content, such as the particular questions, and the other aspect is about form, such as how did the &nbsp;epistemologist behave, what was good, and could be improved. For example, was she neutral enough? Did she press the IL too hard? Was her wording of the questions good? And so on. Sometimes there are two different observers to assess these aspects.</p>\n\n<p>Such feedback can be tremendously helpful in improving your SE skills. Everyone can look at the same dialogue from different angles, and think of better questions that could have been asked. Combining it all together can be a massive boost for all of the participants.</p>\n\n<p>- Thirdly, all the listeners can freely discuss that dialogue for another couple of minutes.</p>\n\n<p>When conducting dialogues we usually divide into several different mini-groups of 3-8 people. Sometimes we can do it in a group of more people if most of them are willing to just listen for the moment, but usually there are several people who are eager to participate.</p>\n\n<p>After the dialogues, which can take another hour or so, we have a second break.</p>\n\n<h3>Additional Activities</h3>\n\n<p>We usually do a second round of practice dialogues, and at the end we give feedback about the meeting itself. We also have giveaway leaflets with some helpful SE info and links.</p>\n\n<p>That's how it usually goes. And here are some more ideas for meeting activities:</p>\n\n<p>- Watch and discuss SE videos together</p>\n\n<p>- Brainstorm SE questions for your real life situations and dialogues</p>\n\n<p>- Discuss the ways of promoting SE still further&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Part 2. Behind the scenes</h2>\n\n<p>Here we present some basic organizational tips for SE meetings.</p>\n\n<h3>Space</h3>\n\n<p>It's important where your meetings take place. Not only does it provide comfort to all of you, but it can also contribute to the stream of future participants if there are other visitors of the same place. For example, we are hosted by the local LessWrong community, in their pay-for-minute cafe which holds a huge variety of events for open-minded people interested in personal growth. They are our target audience, so it's very convenient. And we always make sure there are enough of our leaflets at the reception desk. Another important thing is that there has to be at least one separate room where people can practice SE, so that they would not be distracted by other people. More rooms may be needed depending on the number of people in your SE club.</p>\n\n<h3>Announcements</h3>\n\n<p>Everyone interested should have a possibility to be notified about the upcoming events. We have them in FB, VK (Russian social network) and Telegram, so everyone can choose the source which is more convenient to them. Pre-registration should also be considered if the expected number of people can exceed the capacity of the space you selected.</p>\n\n<h3>Regularity</h3>\n\n<p>It is optimal to have an event regularly at the same time and at the same place, so that less mental effort is required to visit it. We've been having weekly meetings at the same time and place for more than a year now.</p>\n\n<h3>Feedback forms</h3>\n\n<p>You should always try to improve the experience you're giving to your visitors, and in order to get more ideas about what to improve, feedback can be tremendously helpful. We have feedback forms both in paper form and online, and people can anonymously write anything they did or did not like about the event.</p>\n\n<h3>Post-releases</h3>\n\n<p>Photos, videos, audios, ideas, links should be gathered and kept somewhere, optimally posted on social media.</p>\n\n<h3>Team</h3>\n\n<p>It's important to have a management team, because not much can be done by one or two people. We have about 10 enthusiasts who are ready to help and develop SE in different directions. The team has to have regular conference calls or otherwise contact each other where members can exchange ideas about the development of the community and improving their ways.</p>\n\n<h3>Creating new content</h3>\n\n<p>At some point there will probably be at least a couple of people from your team who are able and willing to write their own content on SE and it's nuances. It's great to have your own site or social media public page with your own useful content. And it's also great to keep in touch with members of the international SE community and to share your experience with them.</p>\n\n<h3>Take care of your visitors</h3>\n\n<p>During the event write down all the important information for later – promises of giving some links to someone, important feedback given in verbal form, the new ideas you have come across etc. Also remember to exchange contacts with all the interested people and respond to them afterwards, it will increase the possibility of them coming again.</p>\n\n<h3>Write your checklists</h3>\n\n<p>It's useful to have checklists for all the important things not to forget. You can have a checklist for a host of the event, and another one for a moderator of a mini-group activity, and so on. These roles are not very difficult to perform, and it is useful to have a pool of candidates in place to substitute the primary hosts, if needed.</p>\n\n<h3>Promotion</h3>\n\n<p>It's always useful to promote your activities, so that more people could know about them. You can do it online — mostly through social media via posts, videos, links and management of the community. And also offline — through lectures and workshops.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Please don't be scared by the extensive list of instructions we've given. You don't necessarily need to follow even half of them to start your first local SE club. We started with very few people and very little knowledge of how it's done and what to expect. It was a very long process of creating the experience we are now sharing here. And of course we're still refining the process.</p>\n\n<p>So go on and create your own local community! We believe that together we can make the world a better place. Well, our confidence level is around 90%, and it's totally falsifiable of course. But you get the idea.</p>\n\n<p>Written by Rom Tarasov<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Helping to create such moments and be a part of them is a ton of fun.\n\n</p><p>\nIt's personally fulfilling to me to work towards a world where people use sound methods of forming beliefs and willingly revise their beliefs on encountering new evidence. It happens when I realize I'm wrong about something and update my own beliefs. It also happens when the person I’m talking to begins to doubt or realize that the method they're using is unreliable.\n\n</p><p>\nSE works great in a talk about loosely-held beliefs, but the utility and enjoyment it can yield is even better demonstrated in conversations about deeply-held beliefs. It's a technique that can help the discussion to remain open and sincere by avoiding many of the ways a person can become defensive. That's important during a talk about a belief that may have formed much of their identity since childhood. It can follow the principle of \"first, do no harm\" when it comes to valued relationships.\n\n</p><p>\nI did not expect much success when I first started incorporating this tool into my discussions with family, friends, and acquaintances last year, a few months after I stopped believing in God. So I was pleasantly surprised when one told me that they've been completely rethinking their faith for the first time in 60 years because of our conversations.\n\n</p><p>\nThere tend to be more hurdles to jump over when I talk to people who already know that I'm an atheist. They sometimes distrust my motives, just as I distrusted atheists when I was a believer, thinking that the devil used them to deceive believers. That makes it difficult to reach a point of genuine communication, but most of the time they quickly begin to feel at ease and open up. I get more questions from them than from strangers, so I’ve had a lot of practice answering without derailing the conversation. They are more reluctant to say that they believe because of faith, so we work through the evidence-based reasons for a longer period of time first. It very often turns out that those are not really the main reasons for the belief. When we finally do get to faith, though, it's a great feeling. It's like getting to the boss level in a video game. A recent example is a discussion I had with a Christian friend:\n\n</p><p>\n“What are the main reasons why you believe?”\n\n</p><p>\n“Because we’re designed to need God, and we’re better people when we follow Him.”\n\n</p><p>\n“What evidence would convince you that a different explanation is correct? How could you test your belief to make sure that it’s true?”\n\n</p><p>\n\"I don't think you can create a test for that. We are the way we are. And I believe we're this way for a reason. By design. There are many reasons I believe that, but in the end, it's faith.”\n\n</p><p>\n\"Do you use faith that way in any other area of your life, outside of God?\"\n\n</p><p>\n\"Now that's an excellent and profound question.\"\n\n</p><p>\nThat was exciting for me because it was one of those moments where you stop and think.\n\n</p><p>\nAfter I started talking to strangers, I was surprised by two things: just how common it is to have strong beliefs that are not founded on sound reasoning, and the sheer variety of such beliefs. In addition to religions I’ve never heard of before like Kemet way of life, I’ve run into beliefs in telekinesis, anti-vax, Bigfoot, spontaneous human combustion, anti-microwaves, ancient aliens, spiritual energy connecting the universe, and more. Yet despite this great dissimilarity in beliefs, the talks about them largely follow the same pattern because they are often based on the same underlying reasons.\n\n</p><p>\nPeople seem to genuinely enjoy the conversations, too. I'm getting a lot of thank-yous and a recent session with a stranger ended with \"What you're doing is awesome. Keep it up!\" I try hard to avoid saying something that might offend the other person because it often hinders the openness of the conversation or shuts it down entirely. But in one conversation with an old friend, I wasn’t having much success in eliciting an explanation of how the methods he used to arrive at his God belief could be reliable, so I threw caution to the wind:\n\n</p><p>\n\"Doesn't it bother you that the reasons you rely on to know that your beliefs are true are the very same reasons that terrorists rely on for their beliefs?\"\n\n</p><p>\n[Medium pause] \"But my reasons aren't the same. They rely on indoctrination and I rely on subjective personal experiences that can't be disproved.\"\n\n</p><p>\n\"But don't you use faith to know those experiences are from God, just as they use faith to know their doctrine is from God?\"\n\n</p><p>\n[Long pause] \"You know what? That does bother me.\"\n\n</p><p>\nMoments like that are why I love Street Epistemology.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><hr>\nAbout the author: Daniel is a software engineer and all-around nerd who loves coding, physics, and astronomy.

      "stop-taking-it-all-personally": "<h1>Stop Taking It All Personally</h1>\n\n<p>Successful interventions may depend mostly on your interlocutor.</p>\n\n<p>By Dan Simpson</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-534471447/ep-125-blog-post-stop-taking-it-all-personally-dan-simpson\">Listen to the audio version</a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/seriously-banner.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>How do we know some interventions could have gone better?</h2>\n\n<p>I often get frustrated with unproductive Street Epistemology interviews, many of which leave me wishing I had done something differently. I sometimes beat myself up if, after the interview, I think of something wittier I could have said. The French have a term for this phenomenon which we do not: “L'esprit de l'escalier,” or “Stairwell wit”–to think of a reply too late. What I’m learning through attempting dozens of interviews with a cornucopia of believers is that I should stop beating myself up after bad chats. As long as I am modelling uncertainty, my ability to engender doubt and my ability to help my interlocutor (IL) arrive at more reliable ways of knowing things may be more about what they value than the quality of the Street Epistemology I deliver.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s be honest: when an intervention goes badly, it’s not always on you. A variety of alternative, nearly impossible-to-determine explanations might exist to explain why your IL wouldn't answer questions directly or refused to budge on their stated confidence level after determining their reasons were unreliable. I’m here to tell you: Stop taking it ALL personally. It’s not always about you. Just do your job!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Imparting doubt on the effectiveness of beating myself up</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps like many of you do, I wish lots of conversations had gone differently. Sure, after looking at some of my earliest recorded interventions, many clearly could have had more productive outcomes through a more practiced form of SE, but could all of my unproductive chats? Even if I had years of SE training, how could I truly know all of my least productive interventions could have had a better outcome, for instance, successfully imparting doubt on a believer who believed something I see as irrational? Just because some people are easily dissuaded, does that mean all people will be easily dissuaded?</p>\n\n<p>I like to look back at my old <a href=\"https://www.periscope.tv/idansimpson\">Periscope interviews</a> of believers to see the progression of my ability to elicit doubt. Often, I’ll catch myself face-palming as I watch my early mistakes, many of which seem to lead to less-than-fruitful results. Though, while I notice there’s always room for improvement, the truth may be that there is no amount of training that could have saved some of my least productive chats with believers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>An IL’s revealing statement</h2>\n\n<p>In a recent intervention on Periscope, my IL was 60% certain her belief in Existential Nihilism was a true belief. In the chat I had to backtrack several times just to wrap my head around the belief and the thought process surrounding it. Each time I became lost I simply recapped the conversation we had had up to that point. By the end of my chat, which I didn’t think was particularly effective, she was 45% certain Existential Nihilism was a true belief. A net 15% increase in doubt.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, when I asked why her confidence shifted, the IL replied, “Because you told me my own things I said. (sic) And it made me think and hearing it sounded (sic) Ridiculous to me”.</p>\n\n<p>Wow. What a revealing statement. Just hearing her beliefs come out of my mouth (perhaps a few times) made her confidence drop. That which most specifically led to successfully imparting doubt was my own uncertainty in the intervention which, several times, forced me to me summarize the chat up to that point. It is also possible the sincerity of my uncertainty encouraged the same in her as well.</p>\n\n<p>Stop and think about it: as long as we do a decent job as Street Epistemologists (arguably not very difficult), our ability to successfully impart doubt may be ALL about the IL’s willingness to be open to honest investigation and their willingness to amend their beliefs when viewed through the lens of critical thinking.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>So, let’s say it’s more about the IL than the SE-er; do we stop trying to improve? Why try at all?</h2>\n\n<p>As it is for any dialectical technique used for engaging folks with a particular goal, there will always be room to improve. Continue reviewing your chats (or start now, if you don’t already) with fresh eyes, considering what else you could have done (what alternatives exist?).</p>\n\n<p>If you haven't already started engaging in these types of chats, remember that you’re exactly as good at SE as you need to be right now to have talks with others about the reasons they believe. This alone is a needed public service. Yes, by doing SE more often, with a variety of people, your skills and the quality of interventions will grow naturally and you can begin to elicit doubt more effectively.</p>\n\n<p>For me, realizing there’s always room to improve is reason enough to not take it all personally when an intervention goes wrong. If, perhaps, no amount of practice could help me reach Street Epistemology perfection, then in that sense I am already perfect, right now.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>The spectrum of open-mindedness</h2>\n\n<p>After attempting several interventions, you’ll get a feel for the spectrum of willingness to be open-minded and willingness to change from person to person.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, an IL is not as open and willing as you’d like. You have direct questions about their beliefs but they refuse to answer in a clear way, or they answer a different question than the one you’re asking. These ILs are what I call “squirrely” and can often test my patience. In comparison, when you eventually interview someone who is open-minded and open to change, it can feel akin to cutting soft butter with an extremely sharp knife. SE skills can feel like overkill with certain ILs, especially when you’re chatting with an open-minded individual who values critical thinking but previously hasn’t thought about their belief in depth.</p>\n\n<p>This illustrates further how the immediate outcome of your chats is highly dependent on the openness of your IL. It’s not all about you.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Taking the pressure off yourself</h2>\n\n<p>To me, it begins to seem that no matter the level of enthusiasm or preparation I have for an interview, as long as I do my job by mirroring thought processes and sincerely demonstrating uncertainty, successfully imparting doubt is less about me and what I do and say, and is more about the IL and what they think and value. That’s a meaningful realization because it takes at least some of the pressure off me as a SE. Now, I can stop beating myself up when my wit catches up to me in the stairwell.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Moving forward</h2>\n\n<p>So, what should Street Epistemologists do? How do we do our job to the best of our ability knowing: A) You aren’t as good at SE as you will someday be, and B) The outcome of your interventions depends largely on your IL?</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Simply walk through the door when it’s open and have these conversations more often with more people when they present their beliefs. Be there to put the pebble in the shoe. Perhaps today is the day their laces aren’t laced so tightly.</li>\n\t<li>Listen to and repeat your IL’s words. Compassionately mirror your IL’s thought process. After all, it’s not about you; you want your IL to confront their own ideas and thinking in a way that makes sense to them.</li>\n\t<li>Don’t take it personally when conversations don’t go as well as you had hoped. It takes two to tango. Maybe your IL actually wants to do a waltz. You want to engage in open examination of beliefs, but all they really want to do is to prove you wrong, proselytize or try to frustrate you.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thank you for reading. Be good to yourself; be good to each other. Peace, now.</p>\n\n<p>Dan Simpson - Jan 2017<br>\nTwitter: @iDanSimpson<br>\nPeriscope: @iDanSimpson</p>",

That is, it has no leaders, popes, chieftains, or dictators. It’s simply a method to help others live lives free of delusion.</p>\n\n<p>Think Linux, not Windows. Street Epistemology offers a template that people can build upon. <em>A Manual for Creating Atheists</em>, Anthony Magnabosco’s videos, the Street Epistemology website, <em>Atheos</em>, etc., are all tools to help you develop your own approach when engaging others. Use these as guides—maybe even as confidence boosters—but tweak, innovate, experiment, and play off of your strengths.</p>\n\n<p>Street Epistemology is decentralized, not regimented. It focuses on ideas, not personalities, considers thought leaders’ opinions, yet doesn’t put them on pedestals, and encourages emerging approaches not restrictive rules.</p>\n\n<p>As Street Epistemology becomes more commonplace, it’s even more important to resist the temptation to look to authorities for answers. These are your conversations. Your friends. And helping people in your life to be more reflective, honest, and less dogmatic about their beliefs demands that you use your voice in those conversations. Not mine. Not someone else’s. Yours.</p>\n\n<p>Moving forward, we should try to keep the Open Source model in mind. Don’t be afraid of making mistakes, or subjecting your conversations to scrutiny. That’s how you learn.

      "street-epistemology-the-basics": "<p><img src=\"/blog/images/allegory_of_reason_flat.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1>Street Epistemology: The Basics</h1>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>This article is a brief outline on the basics of Street Epistemology. For more detail, see the 40-page <a href=\"https://streetepistemology.com/publications/the_complete_se_guide\">\"Complete Street Epistemology Guide: How to Talk About Beliefs\"</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The term \"Street Epistemology\" refers to a conversational technique introduced in 2013 by Dr. Peter. Boghossian, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Portland State University. It is a more productive and positive alternative to debates and arguments. A growing number of people worldwide have found value in the technique and are adopting it in their conversations with others about extraordinary (mostly supernatural and/or religious) claims.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of street epistemology is to guide people into engaging their critical thinking skills and applying them to their own beliefs about the world. Street Epistemology is about teaching the most fundamental features of critical thought. It's about helping people recognize the value of skepticism and the scientific method. It's about illuminating the distinction between beliefs about the universe and the objective truth of the universe.</p>\n\n<p>Following is a step-by-step description of how a street epistemology encounter typically proceeds. In addition to \"street epistemology\" (the technique), the abbreviation \"SE\" will stand for \"street epistemologist\", or the person practicing SE (you). Your dialogue partner will be referred to as your \"interlocutor\" (a fancy word meaning \"a person participating in a dialogue\").</p>\n\n<p>SE works best in one-on-one conversations where both participants can apply their full attention to what the other is trying to say. Although direct, real-world encounters are most efficient, people are also experimenting actively with other mediums such as video-chat and online text forums with some success.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Step 1: Build rapport with your interlocutor</h2>\n\n<p>Build rapport with your interlocutor before getting deep into dialogue. Try to find something that you have in common. Taking the time to do this cuts through much of our natural, instinctive, anxiety about immediately engaging with a stranger.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Step 2: Identify the claim</h2>\n\n<p>You may already know what your interlocutor's claim is. For example, you may have initiated the discussion because you overheard them say that they believe in UFOs. Or, if you are actively looking to practice SE on anyone and any subject, this step may involve idle chit-chat with the hope of chancing upon a worthwhile claim. Most people who practice SE are focused on religious claims, so a common claim is something like, \"God is real and the Bible is true\".</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Step 3: Confirm the claim</h2>\n\n<p>Confirm that you have understood your interlocutor correctly by summarizing and repeating their claim back to them. Don't continue until you are both sure that you understand it clearly. If necessary, write down the claim so that you can both refer to it if the conversation goes off track.</p>\n\n<p>For example, you might ask, \"Do I understand correctly that you believe God is a real entity and that the things written in the Bible are truly the word of God?\"</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Step 4: Clarify definitions</h2>\n\n<p>If there are any words that are ambiguous (or potentially so) this would be a good time to nail them down with your interlocutor. For example, sort out what you will both mean when you use the word \"God\" or the word \"true\".</p>\n\n<p>Clarifying definitions is something that you may have to do multiple times as the talk progresses should it become apparent that you're using words differently.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Step 5: Identify a confidence level</h2>\n\n<p>Ask your interlocutor how confident they are that their claim or belief is true. If possible, have them put a number on it. If they are not willing or able to quantify it, accept whatever they give you and note that as their \"initial confidence level\". For example, \"How confident are you that this God is real on a scale of 0 to 100?\"</p>\n\n<p>Note: The confidence scale is just a way of judging for yourself how much effect your efforts are having. It is optional and not an integral part of SE. Don't persist, as doing so may annoy your interlocutor and be counterproductive.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Step 6: Identify the method used to arrive at confidence level</h2>\n\n<p>Ask your interlocutor how they have determined that their belief is true, or how they've arrived at their stated confidence level. They may provide multiple reasons. Try to focus on just one or two, ideally those that contribute the most to their confidence. Once you've settled on a primary reason or method, stay focused on that through the rest of the talk.</p>\n\n<p>For example, you may settle on \"a powerful personal experience\" as their primary reason for believing that God is real.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Step 7: Ask questions that reveal the reliability of the method</h2>\n\n<p>Your main tools here are the Socratic method, the outsider test of faith (OTF), and questions that revolve around the falsifiability of their claims. Ask questions that, when answered, lead to a contradiction of your interlocutor's assumptions or hypotheses.</p>\n\n<p>For example, you might ask, \"If a Hindu woman had a similarly powerful personal experience that convinced her that Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva were real, would that be good evidence that she was correct?\"</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Step 8: Listen, summarize, question, watch, repeat</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Listen</h3>\n\n<p>Listen to your interlocutor closely. Look at them directly and try to understand what they are attempting to convey without getting hung up on their exact word choices.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Summarize</h3>\n\n<p>Repeat what you think your interlocutor is trying to communicate and verify with them that you've understood them correctly. It's important that they feel like they've been heard. It proves that you are being attentive and taking their beliefs seriously.</p>\n\n<p>For example, \"It sounds like what you are saying is [........]; Do I have that right?\"</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Question</h3>\n\n<p>Construct more socratic questions that directly apply to the epistemology they are using (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method\">Socratic Method on Wikipedia</a>)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Watch</h3>\n\n<p>Watch for those special moments where your interlocutor stops to \"think\". This is often betrayed by the act of looking up at the ceiling, clearly trying to sort through things in their head. It's important to detect these \"aporias\" and allow the silence to continue uninterrupted until the interlocutor speaks.</p>\n\n<p>Aporias are signs that you are doing SE right! They may even mark the best time to end your talk as your interlocutor may be left with those thoughts and questions echoing in their mind as they continue their day.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Step 9: Wrap up the conversation</h2>\n\n<p>If your interlocutor previously offered their confidence level, ask them again as you wrap up. This can help you judge whether your dialogue had an immediate effect.</p>\n\n<p>For example, \"Given the things we've talked about, do you think your confidence level has changed? Do you still feel that 100% is accurate?\"</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Step 10: Part company</h2>\n\n<p>What success looks like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The IL feels that the exchange was enjoyable, positive, valuable, etc.</li>\n\t<li>You successfully induced at least one instance of aporia in the interlocutor.</li>\n\t<li>Both parties express a desire to talk again.</li>\n\t<li>A marked change in your interlocutor's self reported level of certainty.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What failure looks like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Arguing and raised voices</li>\n\t<li>Either party feeling frustration</li>\n\t<li>Either party feeling unheard or misunderstood.</li>\n\t<li>Either party regretting having had the conversation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Rules of Thumb</h2>\n\n<p>Pay close attention to your own demeanor. If your words, body language, or tone of voice betray even a small amount of condescension, your interlocutor will recognize this and be justified in reacting negatively to it. If your goal is only to \"win\", and you don't genuinely respect your interlocutor (even if you don't respect their beliefs), then SE might not be right for you.</p>\n\n<p>Don't get pulled into the weeds. Most people new to SE struggle to avoid being sidetracked when they hear clearly false, or unsupportable claims. They reflexively react to them by presenting opposing evidence or arguments. When you do this, you've gone off the rails. It's not a disaster as you can just drop the point and get back on track, but it's normal to struggle with this through many talks before you feel comfortable ignoring these things and staying focused on epistemology.</p>\n\n<p>Don't allow frustration to overwhelm you. Everyone is different. For some people this may be a big challenge but SE requires that you maintain your composure or it's really not SE.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Want to learn more?</h2>\n\n<p>For even more on how to conduct a dialogue, see the <a href=\"https://streetepistemology.com/publications/the_complete_se_guide\">\"Complete Street Epistemology Guide: How to Talk About Beliefs\"</a>.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://streetepistemology.com\">http://streetepistemology.com</a> for information about SE, including links to blog articles, videos, tutorials, forums, apps, social media, helpful documents and diagrams.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>----</p>\n\n<p>J.

But taking this method into the real world can be scary or impractical for some. So I decided to use Omegle, a website that connects you to random strangers.<br>\nI was inspired to keep at it for over 6 months, after being sincerely thanked by my first interlocutor, a fundamentalist Christian. In that timeframe I’ve had many conversations. Almost all of them were very positive for both parties. Within no time I felt like I had a good grasp of the method. There were definitely some struggles using this platform, though. The intention of this post is to give you some suggestions to make your time on there as productive as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Disclaimer</h2>\n\n<p>There are people who use these websites for different purposes. While it is generally not allowed to be nude on these websites, moderation is not perfect. You will encounter people exposing themselves, using drugs and doing all sorts of other things. My suggestions help limit the chances of connecting to them but if this is something you don’t want to be confronted with it may not be the best option for you.</p>\n\n<h2><br>\nSuggestions</h2>\n\n<p>The 2 biggest websites that offer random chats are <a href=\"https://chatroulette.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chatroulette</a> and <a href=\"https://www.omegle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Omegle</a>. In my opinion Omegle is the most suitable and will be the focus of this post since it offers the possibility of adding interests (more on that later on). But try a few. If you can make it work on more platforms, there will also be a bigger pool of people who come into contact with SE.</p>\n\n<p>1. Use video if you’re comfortable with that. Them being able to see you sitting there, listening to them carefully, devoting all your attention to them, is everything. When you’re silent for extended periods of time just listening, it’s important that they know you’re not doing something else on the side. You’re not on your phone, or doing chores, or even listening to music. You’re there for them.</p>\n\n<p>2. Another way to show you’re actually interested in them is to refrain from more general greetings. Instead of saying: “What’s up?” or “How are you doing?”, try: “How are you feeling today?” This indicates interest and you’d be surprised how willing people are to share their most personal feelings and views. The fact that they can skip you whenever they want means that people there are very willing to share. Listen to them. Often times you won’t even have to ask them for a claim. It’ll come out naturally.</p>\n\n<p>3. Experiment with different styles. The great thing about doing SE on websites like this is that it helps you find the style that works best for you. Did you read something on <a href=\"http://streetepistemology.com/\">streetepistemology.com</a> that you want to try out? Do you want to put on a silly hat to get people to notice you? Maybe you see yourself more as the serious listener type? Will putting up a sign work? All is fair game on websites like this. Stumbling and making mistakes is okay. That’s how we learn.</p>\n\n<p>4. Like I mentioned before, Omegle allows you to add interests. Once you add interests the website will then try to connect you to people who also have those interests added. I found that this really helps with connecting to people who are also on there to have conversations instead of other things. When you don’t filter for interests the users you connect to will be completely random and therefore you’ll also connect to more people who are on Omegle to misbehave.</p>\n\n<p>5. It helps to add specific interests that narrow out the sort of claims you’re hoping to talk about. So I put in specific interests like: “religion”, “philosophy”, “psychology”, “christianity”, “islam”, “buddhism”, “karma”, “spirituality”, etc. It even helps to have multiple variations of specific interests. For example: christianity, christ, christian. You can even go into specific denominations. Use as many of these interests as you can possibly think of even if they seem like a long shot. I personally keep adding more and more as they come to mind and have worked my way up to about 40 to 50 interests like this. Some of the people you will connect with on these interests will be very knowledgeable so they can also give you a great challenge.<br>\nHowever, not many people use these specific interests so some patience is required. Don’t expect to connect to people with these interests every time.</p>\n\n<p>6. When Omegle is unable to connect you to someone with your added interests it will fall back on completely random connections (where people misbehave more). So I suggest adding just a handful of more general interests to help avoid this. These interests will be much more common for people to have, so Omegle will then rarely have to go completely random in order to find somebody for you. I’m personally a metalhead and a movie buff so I added: “metal” and “movies”. I wouldn’t do more than 3 of those so that when someone is online with one of your specific interests mentioned above, they don’t get lost in the crowd. If you find yourself connecting to these more general interests all the time and never on your specific interests, consider removing them for a while. I get a good mix of people this way and when I’m tired of focusing on SE I can just have a normal conversation to give myself a little break.</p>\n\n<p>7. Be patient. I have mentioned this before but it deserves special attention. Depending on the time of day and the people online, it may take half an hour to find someone suitable. Don’t let that discourage you. Other times you may connect to the perfect person for you right away.</p>\n\n<p>8. Make an effort to stay civil. Especially if you intend to use the website frequently. You’ll find that there are people who are regulars and you don’t want them bad mouthing you. Maybe a person you don’t think is interesting at this moment might become interesting to you later on. If they’ve gotten in the habit of skipping you, by then there is really nothing you can do about it.</p>\n\n<p>9. Some people might share things about their person that may be beyond your capabilities to deal with. They use websites like this as therapy. I’ve heard multiple stories of abuse. And while these stories are heartbreaking, don’t think you can be their therapist. Always suggest they seek professional care.</p>\n\n<p>10. If someone is in a bad mental state it may also be worth considering whether it’s ethical to start questioning their world view at that point in time. You may be there to change minds but not all minds are stable enough to be fiddled around with.</p>\n\n<p>11. People are gonna be shallow and skip you based purely on your appearance. That’s just how it is. Don’t let that get you down. There’s always more people.</p>\n\n<p>12. Give everyone a chance. As much as people judge you on your appearance, we ourselves make that same mistake sometimes. Some of my best and most meaningful conversations have been with people I least expected it from. A neo-nazi displaying swastikas who instantly greeted me with a nazi salute comes to mind. The conversation I had with him talking about his most personal feelings and struggles and hate was challenging to say the least. No-one had ever really listened to him. He ended up thanking me in tears for opening him up to a more positive view of the world.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nThat’s it. I hope these suggestions help. Now go out there and start practising.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Bio:</h2>\n\n<p>Hello, I’m BystanderCrux.<br>\nI’m an introverted, life-long non-theist who uses structured SE mostly online on platforms like Omegle and Discord.

I had discovered Street Epistemology after having watched the spectacle that was Anthony Magnabosco’s attempt at teaching SE to Aron Ra, like a ballet instructor trying to teach a wrestler to pirouette. I had done my homework—watched the tutorials, various practitioner’s videos, and even slapped together my own SE toolbox with the aid of a some double-sided tape. All I needed to do now was walk up to an actual person and initiate a conversation about their most personal beliefs. No biggy.</p>\n\n<p>Finding a location had been my biggest worry since I started entertaining the idea of taking up SE. It seemed to me that my idols in the US had a much better deal than I—in South Africa, or in my town at least, people seem to keep to themselves, only popping into public when they have to. I set out for the Groenkloof Nature Reserve, the closest thing to a well-frequented public park that I knew of in my area, and hoped for the best.</p>\n\n<p>The park was beautiful. The environment seemed perfectly suited to deep reflection, as long as you could ignore the kwaito rhythmically streaming from parked cars where groups of friends were enjoying the outdoors with a traditional South African braai. The camaraderie was inspiring, until you imagined interjecting yourself into their conversations with what until now seemed to be a simple question: “Excuse me, can you spare 5 minutes to talk about a deeply-held belief?”</p>\n\n<p>I chastised myself as I got back into my car. “You’re chickening out.” I had tried to will myself to approach some of the families at the park, but kept finding excuses not to do so. “Not only do you want to cut into this guy’s family time, but you want him to leave his toddler baking in the sun while he talks to you? You MONSTER.” Defeat was imminent, but I wasn’t ready to give up yet.</p>\n\n<p>My mind was racing. This was my first outing into the world of SE, and returning home without even initiating a conversation seemed unbearable. “What would Anthony do?” Each option that I considered was almost immediately disqualified by the newfound set of requirements I used to discredit the nature reserve. So, even though I knew that it was late afternoon on a Sunday, and that it was probably wishful thinking that anyone would still be there, I set out for the university campus nearby.</p>\n\n<p>Jackpot. I parked close to one of the campus entrances, where students were entering and exiting in dribs and drabs. I took up my clipboard, got out of the car, and started walking up to the first person I saw—and passed them without saying a word. Walking straight up to someone just didn’t seem right, or at least that’s what my stomach that had spontaneously twisted itself into several knots led me to believe. Instead, I took up a spot underneath a jacaranda tree close to the campus entrance, and waited for my first candidate.</p>\n\n<p>Nthabe* was a bright eyed girl who very cheerfully acquiesced to an interview. I immediately started to relax, which was amazing considering that I imagined my greeting spontaneously collapsing to the gravity I had attributed to this moment. Jesus Christ as the one true god was the topic of discussion. The hours on Youtube seemed to pay off, as our conversation identified god’s guidance as the foundation for her belief, as exemplified by her having the opportunity to enroll to university—a first in her family. Our conversation was pleasant. At various times she would pause at my questions, and she had no qualms with responding with an “I don’t know.” After asking her what would change her mind, and she coming to the realization that even when hardship befell her she would consider it a reason to enforce the belief, I was happy to thank her for her time and send her on her way.</p>\n\n<p>My next interlocutor, TK, was a snappily-dressed first year student who put his belief in god at 80% on the confidence scale, with how he was raised being his main reason for believing. After an interesting conversation where he explained that he would be enticed by a religion that was closer to his values, but that he would still find it difficult to abandon the religion of his parents for reasons unknown, we parted with some homework to try and discern why he would be hesitant.</p>\n\n<p>Next up was Jim, with a belief in the importance of kindness. He was kind enough to share that he had reached the lowest point in his life the prior year. This made him realize the importance of empathy and kindness to others, since you do not know what they might be going through. Although this was a very interesting conversation, it was tough, since this was a belief that I shared with him. His belief seemed to be well-founded. He scoffed slightly at the question: “Can kindness be a bad thing?” but identified circumstances where kindness can be taken advantage of. At the end of the conversation, he stated that even though he still believes in its importance, he acknowledges that it should be applied in context to any given situation.</p>\n\n<p>The next interlocutor, Emily, was extremely hesitant to speak to me when I mentioned the topic of the interview. I saw this as an opportunity, and suggested that we could discuss the statement: “It is bad to discuss your beliefs.” She hesitantly decided that she would rather discuss her belief in god. From the outset, it seemed to me as if Emily approached the conversation as a situation where she had to defend her faith. Her epistemology was confusing, but after some discussion we eventually agreed upon stating it as: “Trust in god that provides you with a conviction whereby you know that the Bible is true.” I struggled to point out the circular reasoning of this statement, and was frustrated to discover how many other logical fallacies were layered on top of it. After she found reason after reason to dismiss any conclusion apart from the Christian god using the same mechanism, I considered Emily to be doxastically closed. She was relieved when I finally released her from her trial of faith, and we parted ways amicably.</p>\n\n<p>Finally there was Sfiso, an engineering student who unceremoniously pegged his confidence in the Bible and Christianity at 20%. I was immediately intrigued by his low confidence and instead of asking him why he was still at 20%, I inquired as to his reason for the low confidence. He expressed his theory that the Christian religion might be a mechanism of suppression forced on Africans by colonialists. He also expressed that due to the Bible originating in the Middle East and its seeming indifference to Africa, he struggled to reconcile some of its contents with reality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I really appreciated Sfiso’s honesty, open-mindedness and consideration towards his beliefs. He had mentioned earlier in the conversation that the natural world seemed to him to be evidence of some god. He said that he still read the Bible, attended Church and prayed to god to reveal his true nature to him, which prompted me to present him with a thought experiment. What if, when he was done with his studies, his thirst for truth led him around the world, investigating the claims of each religion? And what if, after his journey, he came to discover that none of the world’s religions correlated to reality to such a degree that it would satisfy him? His answer surprised me. “I would go back to my culture, to my Zulu roots. I would pray to my forefathers, and sacrifice goats to them.” I asked him why he would do so. “Because, if none of these religions gave me a culture, a place to belong, I would have to go back to find a place to belong.” The sentiment was touching and heartbreaking at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>This concluded our talk, and Sfiso jumped at the opportunity to ask me about my beliefs. I explained that I do not believe in any god, and that I couldn’t see a reason to do so until I was provided with evidence—an approach which he found interesting. I took the opportunity to suggest Bart Ehrman’s videos to him, explaining that it provides useful insights into the origins of the New Testament. He accepted the suggestion enthusiastically, writing “BART EHRMAN” on his arm for lack of a piece of paper (Note to self: print some damn cards!). He then stated that he would also like to conduct these interviews, leaving me no other choice but to give him my number and inviting him to get into contact with me if he was interested in more resources or further discussion. My number too was enthusiastically scribbled onto his arm, and we parted with both of us smiling ear-to-ear.</p>\n\n<p>I couldn’t have hoped for a better outcome. The experience left me feeling fulfilled and eager for more. Driving home, I had to stop myself from pulling over and starting up more conversations, satisfied to end on the high note that was my talk with Sfiso. I was hesitant to approach SE in South Africa. I didn’t know how South Africans would react to questions that could so easily be perceived as intrusive. I am pleased to report that this was not the case at all. Even when approaching potential interlocutors, I had a success rate of 1 in 2 at initiating a conversation.</p>\n\n<p>So concludes the diary of my first steps in Street Epistemology. I hope to have many more adventures exploring beliefs, with the sincere hope that no goats are harmed in the process.</p>\n\n<p>*Not their actual names.</p>\n\n<p><em>Ben is a software developer and SE enthusiast from South Africa who hopes that the promotion of critical thinking can save the world.</em><br>\n&nbsp;</p>",
      "taking-se-beyond-religious-claims": "<p>\n</p><center><img src=\"/assets/images/taking_se_beyond_religious_claims.jpg\" style=\"height:20em;\"></center><p>\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h1>Taking SE Beyond Religious Claims</h1>\n<p>\n<em>Mateusz is a physician based in Poland, an atheist and practitioner of Street Epistemology. He enjoys adventure trips, rock climbing and music. </em>\n\n</p><p>\nWhen I became interested in SE almost three years ago, I quickly realized how important it is to lead a life based on reasonable epistemology. How can one make proper decisions without a reliable method of determining what is true or false? Therefore, helping others to reevaluate their approach to truth is worthwhile and morally desirable.\n\n</p><p>\nAlthough questioning the god belief is one of the most popular applications of SE, it isn't the only one. There are plenty of other unjustified claims to question: \"vaccines cause autism\", \"gluten is toxic for humans\", \"9/11 was an inside job\", \"the cure for cancer has already been discovered\" and many more. What links all these claims is a lack of evidence and use of flawed epistemology and modes of justification. After Street Epistemology dialogues, the believer of such claims may reconsider their ways of determining the truth and get closer to reality.\n\n</p><p>\nHere is a short discussion I once had with my friend to illustrate the application of SE outside of religion. The discussion took place in Polish, which I have translated to English:\n\n</p><p>\n[A small party in the garden, my friend sitting with me at the table]\n\n</p><p>\nIL: \"I'm chronically poisoned with mercury.\"\n\n</p><p>\nMe: \"How do you know that?\"\n\n</p><p>\nIL: \"I have the symptoms. And I have a dry skin – it's how the body gets rid of toxins\"\n\n</p><p>\nMe: \"How do you know that your symptoms and a rash are caused by mercury?\"\n\n</p><p>\nIL: \"You are a doctor and you know that mercury poisoning has its symptoms. My symptoms perfectly fit with those described in mercury poisoning\"\n\n</p><p>\nMe: \"Could you tell me about your symptoms? Perhaps you need help.\"\n\n</p><p>\nIL: \"I feel exhausted and I have a dry skin. And you know, I've done a test! Three weeks ago I visited local pharmacy and bought a supplement pill. When I took it, I felt weak, all my muscles were aching and I had diarrhea. The next day I read an article on the Internet that the substance included in the pill has the ability to release mercury deposits from the body, which had caused my symptoms!\"\n\n</p><p>\nMe: \"Let's assume for a while that your pill actually has such properties. How do you know that you have such mercury deposits to be released by this substance?\"\n\n</p><p>\nIL: \"Well, my symptoms fit with those described for mercury poisoning.\"\n\n</p><p>\nMe: \"I understand that you feel weak and have a dry skin. Couldn’t these symptoms be attributed to other ailment than mercury poisoning?\"\n\n</p><p>\nIL: \"Yes, they could.\"\n\n</p><p>\nMe: \"What could you do to determine if you are actually poisoned with mercury?\"\n\n</p><p>\nIL: \"I have the symptoms, as I said!\"\n\n</p><p>\nMe: \"How did you rule out other ailments, more common than mercury poisoning?\"\n\n</p><p>\nIL: \"I don’t have to rule out anything…\"\n\n</p><p>\nMe: \"Why not? You're right that your symptoms could be caused by other ailments.\"\n\n</p><p>\nIL: [long pause]\n\n</p><p>\nMe: \"Have you had your blood or urine checked for mercury in the lab?\"\n\n</p><p>\nIL: \"No, I haven’t\":\n\n</p><p>\nMe: \"So how do you know you're poisoned with mercury?\"\n\n</p><p>\nIL: [silence]\n\n</p><p>\nMe: \"Perhaps you should go to a clinic, talk about your symptoms and have some tests. I'm sure they will help you. If you want to read about mercury poisoning on the Internet I recommend PubMed.com website. There you can find many interesting scientific articles.\"\n\n</p><p>\nIL: \"Thanks. I didn’t know that webpage. PubMed, yeah?\"\n\n</p><p>\nMe: \"Yes.\"\n\n</p><p>\n[Long silence. Other people came in and the topic wasn't brought up again]\n\n</p><p>\nThe claim concerned mercury poisoning of my interlocutor. My first step was to examine whether it was justified to make such a claim. It's a good advice to visit a clinic when having symptoms, but I couldn't propose it too early – it would invoke a defensive posture of being neglected and misunderstood. When asked for evidence of their claim, my interlocutor revealed confirmation bias and flawed epistemology. And this was the place where SE came in. Through asking questions, my interlocutor recognized that their reasoning was flawed. I then recommended visiting a clinic and reading some peer-reviewed papers (since my interlocutor studied biology), instead of anecdotes and opinion pieces on the Internet.\n\n</p><p>\nYou can introduce SE on many topics but be aware that it can be more difficult than on religious claims. In dialogue about god beliefs, we are much better prepared since we know this subject and interlocutors of many religions use similar justifications that come up frequently. On other topics we may not be experts and may even feel out of our depth on hearing something like \"Gluten is toxic for humans, and I'll describe for you how it influences enterocytes in human digestive tract!\" What can we do in these situations?\n\n</p><p>\nFirst of all, we can avoid assuming that the interlocutor is wrong. The fact that their claim seems extraordinary doesn't mean it is false, only that it calls for strong evidence. Secondly, we can still assess the process that led the interlocutor to their conclusion, without being an expert on the subject. If their epistemology is flawed, I try to show this in a friendly way and help my interlocutor change it. If I can't find a flaw due to unfamiliarity with the field, there's no shame in saying \"I don't know much about that subject, but I'll read up on it for next time.\"  If the interlocutor does present reliable epistemology and their evidence checks out, we can still benefit by changing our mind and learning something new.\n\n</p><p>\nNothing prevents you from applying SE to beliefs other than god beliefs. Make sure you understand your interlocutor, ask for evidence and assess the reliability of a claim and help your interlocutor change their flawed epistemology. Don't deny the claim just because it is extraordinary, and remember that sometimes you can also learn something new. Keep discussing! These discussions can be rewarding for you and your interlocutors.\n\n</p><p>\n<em>\"So long as men are not trained to withhold judgment in the absence of evidence, they will be led astray by cocksure prophets, and it is likely that their leaders will be either ignorant fanatics or dishonest charlatans. To endure uncertainty is difficult, but so are most of the other virtues.\" - Bertrand Russell</em>\n\n</p><p>\n\n\t\t</p>",

It will discuss some basic concepts about how beliefs model reality and how epistemology functions as a factory for forging beliefs from the raw material of evidence.  It should help you gain a clear and solid understanding of where to focus your attention so that you can practice Street Epistemology more easily and effectively.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Belief Formation</h2>\n<p>\nWe exist in reality.  We collect data about reality using our senses.  This data is the evidence we use to understand the nature of reality.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><center><img src=\"https://streetepistemology.com/img/16/belief-factory-01.jpg\"></center>\n\n<p>\nWe use our minds to convert evidence into internal, mental descriptions or <i>models</i> of reality.  The model is our understanding of what reality <i>is</i> and how it works.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><center><img src=\"https://streetepistemology.com/img/17/belief-factory-02.jpg\"></center>\n\n<p>\nExample: We perceive a wooden crate in front of us using our eyes and hands to explore its contours.  This information is used to help create or reinforce our belief that the wooden crate is <i>box shaped</i>. \n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Beliefs About Reality Are Models</h2>\n<p>\nWhen we talk about our beliefs, we are talking about abstract, internal models of how the real world is and works.  These models exist only as ideas in our minds.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><center><img src=\"https://streetepistemology.com/img/18/belief-factor-03.jpg\"></center>\n\n<p>\nExample: If someone believes in an afterlife, their mental model of reality includes the idea that people possess a property that persists after their body dies.  Those who believe this property exists often call it a <i>soul</i>.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Beliefs May Not Be Accurate</h2>\n<p>\nOur beliefs (models of reality) may or may not correspond well with reality itself.  When a model is less accurate in this way, we call it a false belief.  When our model is more accurate, we say that the belief is true.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><center><img src=\"https://streetepistemology.com/img/19/belief-factory-04.jpg\"></center>\n\n<p>\nExample: If you believe a box to be \"a three-dimensional geometric shape that tapers smoothly from a flat base (frequently, though not necessarily, circular) to a point called the apex or vertex\", then your belief would be false as a model of reality.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Beliefs Are Not Reality</h2>\n<p>\nBeliefs people hold about reality are not <i>actually</i> reality.  Beliefs are simplified abstractions.  The fact that these abstractions have the potential to be inaccurate proves that they are, in fact, two different things.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><center><img src=\"https://streetepistemology.com/img/20/belief-factory-05.jpg\"></center>\n\n<p>\nOnce people have formed their beliefs, (consciously or unconsciously, intentionally or unintentionally) they often interact with the world as if those beliefs are, in fact, reality.  They behave as if there is no relevant difference. When someone points to something and says, \"That is a box\", does that mean the thing really <i>is</i> a box?  Or is it just an arrangement of atoms and molecules that happens to match our mental model of \"box-like\" things?  The concept (box) and the thing (the atom stuff) are independent of each other.  We commonly ignore this difference for convenience.  However, if someone has never needed to see the distinction, they may be consciously unaware of it and go through life as if the two are entirely synonymous.\n\n</p><p>\nIt can be extremely difficult to practice Street Epistemology when someone struggles with this distinction.  Therefore, it may be useful to ensure that your interlocutor understands the difference up front to save both parties some aggravation.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Beliefs Inform Our Actions</h2>\n<p>\nThough our beliefs about reality are mental abstractions distinct from reality itself, they are the only things we have to work with as we live our lives.  When we make choices about how to act, we base those actions on our understanding of reality – our beliefs – our mental model of how reality is and works.\n\n</p><p>\nExample: If someone believes that their god wants them to punish a rape victim with stoning, they may choose to take the action of killing a woman.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Inaccurate Beliefs Can Cause Harm</h2>\n<p>\nPeople live in societies where their actions inevitably affect other people.  If our beliefs are not true and our beliefs inform our actions, then our beliefs (indirectly) and our actions (directly) have a very real potential to cause harm to ourselves and others.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><center><img src=\"https://streetepistemology.com/img/21/belief-factory-06.jpg\"></center>\n\n<p>\nExample:  If someone believes that vaccines cause autism, but in fact they do not, they may choose not to vaccinate their child, thereby putting their child and others in the community at risk of serious illness or death.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Epistemology</h2>\n<p>\nEpistemology is concerned with the theory of knowledge.  It is the study of the nature of knowledge, justification, and the rationality of belief <sup>1</sup>.  A person's \"epistemology\" is the process they use to convert evidence into beliefs.  It is the factory that transforms the raw material of evidence into the final product of belief.  To avoid inaccurate beliefs we need to look upstream of the beliefs themselves because they are not the problem; The problem lies in the process (the epistemology) that <i>transformed</i> the evidence into those beliefs.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Good v. Bad Epistemologies</h2>\n<p>\nGood epistemologies are those that are reliable at producing beliefs that more accurately correspond to reality.  Poor epistemologies are those that fail to do so.\n\n</p><p>\nReligious faith is an example of poor/unreliable epistemology.  It is subjective, vulnerable to personal bias, and typically relied upon in the absence of good critical thinking skills.\n\n</p><p>\nScientific methods are examples of good/reliable epistemology.  They strive to be rigorous, objective, and based entirely on empirical observation and logic.  \n\n</p><p>\n</p><center><img src=\"https://streetepistemology.com/img/22/belief-factory-07.jpg\"></center>\n\n<p>\nExample: Even though two people might collect the same evidence (a child became autistic after being vaccinated) they could arrive at two very different beliefs.  Why?  Because their epistemologies were different.  Their reasoning processes (belief factories) differed enough that they converted the same input into different output.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Street Epistemology</h2>\n<p>\nStreet Epistemology is a form of conversation that relies heavily on Socratic questioning <sup>2</sup>.  It attempts to reveal poor epistemologies and demonstrate better ones while simultaneously employing the necessary social skills to help avoid unproductive emotional responses and encourage empathetic attitudes.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Why Street Epistemology Is Better</h2>\n<p>\nIf we accept that actions based on inaccurate beliefs are undesirable, then we should strive to avoid arriving at inaccurate beliefs.  Unfortunately, if you want to challenge someone's very deeply held (but probably inaccurate) belief about reality, presenting them with alternative evidence will typically fail.  This is because you haven't altered their epistemology.  They will simply feed your alternative evidence into their faulty factory and come up with another bad conclusion.  Evidence in support of your own belief will only work if their factory works in the same way as yours.\n\n</p><p>\nStreet Epistemology specifically tries to focus on a person's epistemology (the factory), not on their beliefs or their evidence.  The goal is to reveal to both participants the thinking process that leads from evidence to conclusion. \n\n</p><p>\n</p><h3>Never mind the evidence:</h3>\n\n<p>\nWhen someone presents evidence that you know is poor, resist the urge to refute it with a competing bit of evidence.  Instead, try to form questions that delve into what your interlocutor is <i>doing</i> with that evidence.  Once they discover the flaw(s) in their reasoning (the defect(s) in their factory), they will change <i>how</i> they evaluate evidence (repair the defect(s)).  They will have improved their critical thinking skills and be better equipped to skillfully evaluate evidence in the future.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h3>Never mind the beliefs themselves:</h3>\n\n<p>\nWhen they tell you about conclusions they've reached that you feel are erroneous, don't respond with alternative conclusions that make more sense to you; Set those aside.  Instead, keep exploring how they transformed their evidence into those conclusions.  When they themselves discover the flaws in their own logic, this will eventually result in improved critical thinking skills that can be applied to any subject going forward. \n\n</p><p>\n</p><h3>Focus On the Factory:</h3>\n\n<p>\nFor example, when you detect a logical fallacy, don't point out that they've fallen victim to a logical fallacy.  Instead ask a question that allows them to discover for themselves the flaw in the logic.  For example, if your interlocutor says:\n\n</p><p>\n</p><blockquote>\n     \"My evidence is that my son got autism immediately after being vaccinated.\"   \n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nYou could respond with:\n\n</p><p>\n</p><blockquote>\n     \"Aha!  You've fallen victim to the cum hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy!\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nBut this will likely be received poorly and lead to debate.  Your best clue that this is not a great response?  It's not a question.  A better response would be:\n\n</p><p>\n</p><blockquote>\n    \"Is it possible for a thing to happen right after something else, even though the first thing was not actually the cause of the second?\" \n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nHere, you're inviting them to analyze the thinking process they're using and hopefully realize for themselves that correlation does not equal causation.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>\nIn conclusion, when attempting to use Street Epistemology, I recommend keeping this image in your mind.  \n\n</p><p>\n</p><center><img src=\"https://streetepistemology.com/img/23/belief-factory-08.jpg\"></center>\n\n<p>\nAbove all, stay focused on the belief factories.  If you get distracted and pulled into the weeds, don't worry about it.  Just stop and return to the factory.  It will become a lot easier with practice.\nGood luck!\n\n</p><p>\n</p><hr>\n\n<p>\n</p><h2>References</h2>\n<p>\n</p><ol>\n<li>Epistemology. (2017, August 2). In Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.

After all, this is his List!\n\n</p><p>\n</p><blockquote>\"What qualifies one to be a member of the 10,000? Well, there are no rigorous criteria. There are no membership dues. No place we congregate. No tests we take. You just need to be committed. Committed to helping people lead more reflective lives. Committed both to listening and to speaking up when you hear under-evidenced views that do not align with reality. But also committed to changing your mind if they do align with reality. So commitment is vital. That doesn’t mean every single interaction, but it does mean it’s something in which one is actively engaged. And one MUST be committed to not taking money if they help someone break through dogmatism. So those are the qualities we need to turn the tide on irrationality.\"\n\n<p>\n— Dr. Peter Boghossian, via email on Sun, Jul 10, 2016 at 11:07 PM\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>\n</p><h2>Coming and Going</h2>\n<p>\nAs a member of this site, you can easily add or remove yourself from the List of 10,000 as necessary. Please note, however, that your place in the queue (also known as your Join List Date) will be reset. And because we understand that some people require anonymity, you have a great deal of control as to how your name and location appears on the List. \n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Help Spread the Word</h2>\n<p>\nPlease help us reach Boghossian's goal of 10,000 people by sharing his book, a video, a podcast, or a story where someone used Street Epistemology with your friends, family, and colleagues.\n\n</p><p>\nIf you have any questions or thoughts about the List of 10,000, please comment on this post below!\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Some History</h2>\n<p>\nOne of the main goals stated in Dr. Peter Boghossian's book was to educate and inspire enough people to regularly use the method of Street Epistemology so that our efforts would start to have a noticeable, beneficial impact on humanity.\n\n</p><p>\nWhen I read his book 2013, I was intrigued by Boghossian's bold call for 10,000 people to help humanity become more reasonable and rational. And I immediately wanted to be a part of it.\n\n</p><p>\nA little googling back then brought me to this very website, where an enterprising man named Leif Cid, completely on his own initiative, was compiling the names of people who emailed him and asked to join. As interest in Street Epistemology increased over the months and years, the number of people asking to join the List of 10,000 also grew, outpacing our ability to keep the site current.\n\n</p><p>\nWhile the majority of our discussions about technique and strategy regarding SE take place on the Private Street Epistemology Facebook Group, there was no good way of keeping tracking of people who wanted to join the List, so a small team of volunteers worked to update the functionality of this website to not only offer a portal to all things SE, but to create a more scalable meeting place, including the ability for members to add (and remove) themselves from the List.\n\n</p><p>\nWhile embarking on the re-design, the team realized that it would be nice to not only give people the ability to specify how their name and location appear on the List, but to include some demographics (e.g., city, state, country, belief type, etc.). While this website and its content are not in any way controlled by Boghossian, we do have his support behind managing the List of 10,000. In other words, this is the Official List.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Respecting the Early Adopters</h2>\n<p>\nAs much as we wanted to build up \n<a href=\"https://streetepistemology.com/the-10000/\">The List of 10,000</a>\nin the same order as people requested to join it, the task proved too difficult due to distributed record-keeping. However, we did manage to re-invite those people who emailed us to create a new account on the website and consider joining the List, starting from 2013 to current date. We thank you for your understanding in the event you were not accurately transferred over to this List.\n\n</p><p>\nAuthor: Anthony Magnabosco\n\n</p><p>\n\n\t\t</p>",

This post will focus specifically on the things one can do in order to give an informative talk on Street Epistemology (SE), based on more than a dozen presentations I’ve given on the subject over the years.</p>\n\n<p>As more and more individuals have started learning about (and have become enchanted with!) SE, requests from people on how to best give a talk about this method to their local groups have increased. I will link to this article when future requests for advice roll in, and I will append more tips as comments below as new suggestions arise.</p>\n\n<p>This article is broken up into three sections: things to consider <em>before</em> giving your talk, things to cover <em>during</em> your talk, and things to do <em>after</em> your talk on Street Epistemology.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Things to Consider Before Giving Your Street Epistemology Talk</h2>\n\n<p>Take the time leading up to your talk to address these details in advance.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Assess Your Audience</h3>\n\n<p>Understanding the composition of your audience is an important consideration. How many people will attend? Will most be familiar or unfamiliar with SE? Can you expect hostile detractors? Having an understanding of who will likely be attending is a good first step before you prepare one slide or talking point.</p>\n\n<p>If your audience will be primarily comprised of people who have never heard of SE, extra time will be needed to cover the basics. With a more familiar crowd, you can gloss over the basics and delve into the deeper concepts.</p>\n\n<p>As SE becomes more commonplace, the number of people who may take issue with the method will probably increase, so be prepared for people who may want to disrupt your talk and have a plan in place for how to deal with interruptions.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Respect Your Assigned Duration</h3>\n\n<p>Receive in writing how much time you will have to give your talk and, if possible, to take questions from the audience. Stick to that plan as best you can out of respect for everybody involved.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, be prepared to scale back or expand your talk, just in case the situation changes on the day of your presentation. I like to have an extra video example and a few more slides tucked away just in case, and have had to use these on more than one occasion.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that a 20-minute talk with no time for questions will be a much different talk than one where you have 1.5 hours and a generous time at the end to answer audience inquiries.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Record and Share</h3>\n\n<p>If your hosts will allow it, give serious consideration to recording your talk so that others may enjoy it. Why spend time preparing for a talk on SE to one room of 30 people when you can record and upload it for thousands? It takes a great deal more effort to capture and edit the talk, but well worth it if you can spare the time and have some familiarity with the equipment needed.</p>\n\n<p>If possible, I suggest that you bring your own recording equipment and have a friend or two help you set things up at least two hours beforehand, instead of relying on your hosts to capture the talk. I’ve literally waited months to get my hands on host-captured footage, only to find that the quality was poor or some other issue prevented me from using it. Do everyone a favor and take equipment that you are familiar with and record everything yourself.</p>\n\n<p>If possible, orient the video camera so the screen displaying your slides and video are NOT in the shot. You can easily add your slides and video examples later during the video editing process, and it will look a lot better than some fuzzy screen. In this setup, stay in one spot and keep the camera trained on you, preferably with a non-distracting background, and your final video will look much better.</p>\n\n<p>Another important consideration is the privacy of your audience. Assume that not everyone will be happy to be included in your video, so face the camera so no one will also be recorded. You don’t want to go through all the effort of preparing, giving, recording, editing, and uploading your talk, only to learn that someone who was in the audience wants you to take it down because they're not out to their family and friends.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Consider Your Safety</h3>\n\n<p>For the most part, your audience will probably be very welcoming and excited to hear your talk. But that may not always be the case. Discuss with your organizers in advance how to handle hecklers and the best exit route if you feel like your safety is in jeopardy.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Things to Consider During Your Street Epistemology Talk</h2>\n\n<p>Keep the following suggestions in mind while giving your presentation.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>First Steps</h3>\n\n<p>One of the first things I like to do before getting too far into my talking points is to query the audience to see how many people are familiar with SE. Even if you don’t plan to make one change to your talk, asking this question shows an interest in your audience, and could give the impression that you are planning a customized talk just for them.</p>\n\n<p>Also be sure to explain to people early on why SE is important to you. Share something personal with your audience so that they can better understand what motivates you.</p>\n\n<p>This is also a great opportunity to set some ground rules: let people know they can ask their questions at the end of your talk, or if you prefer a hand raise in the middle of your presentation.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Lay Out Your Plan</h3>\n\n<p>Tell the audience very early on what you plan to cover, and the order in which you plan to cover it. For example, “After I cover some basics on SE, I’ll show a video, delve into some deeper concepts, and then open it up for the Q&amp;A.”</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Required Talking Points</h3>\n\n<p>I think there are a few topics that nearly every SE talk should contain:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>A quick review of the history of the method is essential, including a reference to the Socratic method, Peter Boghossian’s book <em>A Manual for Creating Atheists</em>, a definition of the word “epistemology”, and how people are taking the method into exciting new directions.</li>\n\t<li>Clear up the common misconception that one has to initiate talks with strangers in public for it to be considered Street Epistemology. It can’t hurt to mention this a few times during your talk.</li>\n\t<li>Explain that SE is never about telling people what to think, like an evangelizer or proselytizer might do. Rather, SE is about asking questions to understand what a person believes, why they believe it, and how they determined that their methods were reliable.</li>\n\t<li>While you may feel differently about it, I think we have an obligation to be available for people once we’ve had an SE-based discussion with them. Discovering that a core belief you have may be unjustified can be very unsettling, and we should be accessible to guide people to support-related resources if they request it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Words Matter</h3>\n\n<p>It’s interesting how one or two words can distort the entire tenor of your talk. Avoid framing Street Epistemology as “<strong>getting</strong> people to change” or “<strong>making</strong> people see they’re wrong”. Instead, frame your message in terms of helping people correct their possibly mistaken views of reality, because that’s largely the goal here. Better framing examples are “<strong>helping</strong> people reflect on their beliefs” or “<strong>assisting</strong> people with the discovery that they could be mistaken”.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Show an Example</h3>\n\n<p>One of the best ways to help your audience get excited about and better understand SE is to show one of your favorite video examples. I would not recommend playing a video for any longer than 10 or 12 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Also, be sure to “setup” the video before playing it, so you can prepare your audience for what they are about to see. For example, “In this video, a guy is standing on a college campus asking people to stop and chat about one of their deeply-held beliefs. A woman agrees to discuss her belief in karma, and the video will start playing after he’s asked her to chat, explained his purpose, and started a timer for five minutes. Pay attention to how many questions he asks, his respectful tone, and how much space she’s given to think things through.”</p>\n\n<p>Don’t feel like you have to choose examples where the topic is exclusively about God claims. SE is perfect for other claims like karma, ghosts, social and political issues, horoscopes, etc. In fact, expanding your examples to less controversial topics may help your audience avoid getting too wrapped up in the topic and stay more focused on the technique.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid the temptation to perform a live example in front of the audience. Your volunteer may be nervous, you may be nervous, and the whole thing may leave the crowd with a completely different perception than you want. Instead, direct people to the now hundreds of video examples that are available online today. If they persist, agree to conduct a small chat with someone after your talk has completely concluded and you have had a chance to relax a bit after your talk.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Questions and Answer Session</h3>\n\n<p>The Q&amp;A portion of your talk is usually the most informative and engaging part for both the presenter and the audience. A little planning here can really help leave attendees with a lasting impression.</p>\n\n<p>Whether or not your talk is being recorded, or the audience member has a microphone where everyone can easily hear, always summarize and repeat back the question you are being asked. This adds clarity and may help subsequent questions from the audience to be more concise. If someone asks a good question, let them know it by saying, “Great question!”. This simple phrase should encourage more people to participate. Don’t be afraid to interrupt people who are taking too long and say, “What is your question, please?”; audience members will likely thank you for interjecting and keeping things focused.</p>\n\n<p>Even though you may have covered this in your talk, someone will almost invariably ask how SE differs from proselytizing, so have a good answer prepared in advance.</p>\n\n<p>Another increasingly common question I have started to experience recently is how one should square the lofty goals of SE with the oftentimes contradictory antics from atheists in the public sphere. Give some thought as to you how you would like to explain that the actions of people who advocate SE are unrelated to the goals of the method itself.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Things to Consider After Your Street Epistemology Talk</h2>\n\n<p>Try to extend your engagement with your audience long after the talk ends.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Be Accessible</h3>\n\n<p>If you are comfortable doing so, try to be as accessible as possible for people interested in SE. If you have a social media presence, blog, or YouTube channel, make sure you provide those links. Sometimes the best questions or comments surface long after the talk ends, simply because an audience member was too shy to talk with you in person.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Solicit Feedback</h3>\n\n<p>Many people will hold off on telling you how you can improve for next time because they don’t want to come across as critical. But if you actively solicit feedback, audience members can give you the best advice that you can incorporate for next time. Something like, “Now that my talk is done, I’d really like your honest feedback of what you enjoyed and what can be improved upon before I give a talk on this topic again.” can generate wonderful ideas.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Inspire Action</h3>\n\n<p>Don’t miss the opportunity to encourage people to support Street Epistemology in some way. If they are interested in conducting SE, direct them to one of the related Facebook groups. If they want to help promote the method, direct them to the SE Website or other resources so that they can share with friends. If they have other skills that might be able to help, encourage them to reach out to the community so we can see what might be a good fit.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Share Your Work</h3>\n\n<p>If your presentation went well, consider uploading your files to the Private Street Epistemology Facebook Study Group so that others can use your materials. Make a post in one of the SE groups to explain what parts went well, and which parts seemed to lag. If you have recorded your talk, be sure to provide a link to your presentation so that it might be shared on social media by others interested in this method.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Presentations on Street Epistemology are educational and promotional opportunities that should not be squandered. With a little planning, every single minute of your talk can be optimized for maximum impact.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"http://anthonymagnabosco.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Anthony Magnabosco</a> is a provisional atheist and a frequent practitioner and promoter of Street Epistemology.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

There is much more room for practicing Street Epistemology on politics, health and lifestyle topics. In this post I've provided ideas to help you apply SE to secular topics and achieve more progress in conversations, in particular how to make ambiguous claims testable and also how to apply SE-style questioning to ethical claims.</p>\n\n<h2>Start At The End</h2>\n\n<p>Everyone wants to achieve their goals. On the one hand, your success is affected by having an accurate map of reality, and there your epistemology plays a key role. On the other hand, your goals follow from the values you hold dear, and there your ethical system plays a key role. And so we come to two tracks at the very beginning of the dialogue:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Scientific track: </strong>&nbsp;The interlocutor (IL) says something clearly contrary to modern scientific understanding, examining IL’s epistemology the classic SE way seems to be a good option. Questions of type “What is really out there?” fall into this category.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ethical track:</strong> &nbsp;The IL talks about values, and so you look closer into the value system. Much like a belief, there might be contradictions, fallacies and delusions here worth exploring. Here the questions like “How should it be?” are the most pertinent.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let’s take LGBTQ+ topic to illustrate. Consider the following statements that might be made by someone opposed to rights for gay families and how you might challenge them:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\"Children from gay families suffer from psychological disorders\"</li>\n\t<li>\"Gay couples are sinful/disgusting, therefore gay marriage should be banned\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In response to the first statement you might take the scientific track, and in response to the second you might take the ethical track. Let's now look more closely at the two tracks.</p>\n\n<h2>Scientific Track</h2>\n\n<p>We call this the scientific track because it's about testing ideas about the world or what causes something. Although scientists perform rigorous tests and take steps to counteract confirmation bias and other <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases\" target=\"_blank\">pitfalls</a>, non-scientists also test their ideas about the world all the time. To be clear, we're usually making sloppy tests with sample size 1 and rarely shout \"my hypothesis has been falsified!\" when it starts raining after having decided not to bring an umbrella, but testing our ideas remains an everyday activity. For this reason, you can take the scientific track with an interlocutor without framing it in scientific jargon like the null hypothesis or falsification, but with appropriate everyday questions.</p>\n\n<p>Techniques you can use in order to tie meaningless claims to reality:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>“Does the truth of the claim affect the experiences you do and do not <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/\" target=\"_blank\">anticipate</a>?”. If a claim does not affect expectations in any way, or the observations are not demonstrable, you might consider reformulating the claim or suggesting your IL to think about utility of such claims;</li>\n\t<li>“How could we distinguish the world where the statement is true from the one where it is false?” is a variation of the question above.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Mind_projection_fallacy\" target=\"_blank\">Mind projection fallacy</a> check. People tend to assume others value and perceive the world the same way they do. Such words as success, intelligence, influence, erudition, difficulty, respect, taste etc. are prone to misunderstanding.“What do you mean by that?” question should clarify the subtleties of the terms, and the question: “Can others perceive or value the same thing differently?” invites IL to seek alternative explanations. Also, sometimes the claim is actually not about the outer world, but about inner properties of the brain. “If there is a process in a brain that makes you feel that it is true, would you want to know?” is a question I asked a free will proponent. Giving an example helps, too: “Is there a chance that there is some mind trick behind this, like with white-and-gold or black-and-blue dress?”</li>\n\t<li>Comparison. In science, null hypothesis usually is that there is no difference between two alternatives. Without alternatives stating a null hypotheses might be a trouble. &nbsp;Concerning the LGBTQ+ example, children from gay families should be compared to children from heterosexual families, and the underlying null hypothesis is “Sexual orientation of parents does not predict psychological disorders of children better than chance”.</li>\n\t<li>Reduction. The point of reduction is to substitute the initial question with one or more factual questions accounting for the initial one. Raising contradictions in factual questions may lead to a shift on the confidence scale concerning the initial, regardless of it being objective or subjective. To find out who was a better president, you can ask your IL which means he uses to justify his belief, and maybe suggest to select the most significant from the list of possible factors, such as scientific progress, economic achievements or improvement in other aspects like social welfare or culture. This might be a sequel of the “expected observable consequences” question. I should note that in case IL decides who was better mainly on the basis of liking or disliking, the ethical track is preferable.</li>\n\t<li>Metric. Introducing a measure teleports the discussion to just one step away from resolving the initial question. Continuing with LGBTQ+ example, the appropriate metrics might be frequency, duration or severity of pre-agreed list of disorders.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After you've put the claim into a testable form, you can explore IL’s epistemology the classic SE way. Or you can compile all the work into one final question:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>“If you find out that, all else being equal, children have about the same frequency of disorders irrespectively of the sexual orientation of their parents, how would that information affect your confidence?”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Ethical Track</h2>\n\n<p>SE primarily focuses on epistemology of claims about what is real or not, but you can take a related approach to addressing claims about what is right or wrong. There are a lot of harmful beliefs in morality worth inducing doubt on, where knowledge of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliabilism\" target=\"_blank\">reliabilism</a> is just not enough.</p>\n\n<p>And there consequentialism comes to the rescue. Simply put, consequentialism states that the better the state of the world the action leads to, the better the action is. Comprehensively explained <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161115073538/http://www.raikoth.net/consequentialism.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, I would like to introduce a few ideas from the article and how they can be incorporated in SE dialogue. Note that the text below is a system of intuitions of the author, not an expert judgement.</p>\n\n<h2>Strategy</h2>\n\n<p>Most common problem I faced is that ILs gave only arguments which <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\" target=\"_blank\">supported their own position</a>, for example, death penalty advocates never payed attention to negative consequences. And the question “Do you see any cons in death penalty?” draws IL’s attention to the other side of the problem, which often results in openness and shift on the confidence scale. There are more sophisticated cases where negative consequences have no effect on IL’s confidence, though, so let’s proceed.</p>\n\n<h2>How do you know that it’s good?</h2>\n\n<p>Some people tend to use ways of justifying a moral belief in contexts where they may be unreliable, or where the quality of decision is crucial and speed is not. Like ways of knowing, e.g. personal experience or testimony in classic SE, these ways of evaluating actions should be questioned:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_heuristic\" target=\"_blank\">Affect heuristic</a>. “Gay couples are disgusting, therefore gay marriage should be banned” is the example of how this mental shortcut is used to justify a claim. If one did something on the basis of liking or disliking, does it mean he committed a good thing? Can one use disgust as a way to determine what to do and commit a bad thing?\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Shame or guilt. If one feels bad after doing something, does it mean he did a bad thing?</li>\n\t\t<li>Warm fuzzies. If one feels good after doing something, does it mean he did a good thing?</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Social signaling. Observing a person doing something affects our expectation of him belonging to certain social groups. Some actions affect our confidence stronger than others. In particular, the more improbable the action is, given that the person does not belong to the social group, the bigger the effect is. Buying a diamond is a signal of wealth, because this purchase is not likely otherwise, as diamonds are made a little use of in households. If one did something to prove others he belongs to the social group, does it mean he committed a good thing?</li>\n\t<li>Deontology. “Homosexual behavior breaks divine laws, and is therefore wrong” falls into this category. If an action according to the rule leads to worse consequences than another action, why would you want to follow it? More information on this in the section below.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As you can see, traditional techniques like Outsider Test and Socratic Method can be applied to ways of determining what is good, too.</p>\n\n<h2>Deontology</h2>\n\n<p>Deontology is often set against consequentialism, as instead of judging an action on the basis of consequences the action leads to, deontology states that the better an action corresponds to a set of rules, the better the action is. The rules may be called “commandments”, “principles”, “rights”, “laws”, “norms”, “standards” etc.</p>\n\n<p>The central problem of deontology is the origin of rules, so don't confuse it with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism#Two-level_consequentialism\" target=\"_blank\">two-level consequentialism</a>, where rules are based on consequences and result from the tradeoff between flexibility and reliability. For example, “Stealing is bad unless one has a good reason for it” will likely lead to a worse state of the world than “Stealing is bad” would. Furthermore, these rules may be overridden, if the proper examination of consequences produces better results.</p>\n\n<p>However, not all rules are consequences-based. Some claim divine origin or an underlying universal metaphysical “Law”, and some are just floating without any non-arbitrary justification. Adherents of pure deontology, free of assessment of any real-world consequences, should be given a chance to perform that assessment themselves and become more aware of the disadvantages of their ethical system.</p>\n\n<h2>Noncentral Fallacy</h2>\n\n<p>Popular incarnation of deontology is <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/e95/the_noncentral_fallacy_the_worst_argument_in_the/\" target=\"_blank\">noncentral fallacy</a>, for example, “abortion is murder”. Supposedly, a person saying this keeps in mind the rule “murder is bad”. Abortion might have similarities with murder, and on the basis of these abortion is pronounced bad. The fallacy occurs mainly because of the assumption that all the murders are equally bad. Abortion is not a typical murder, so it might be good to ask: “Is it a typical murder, like a mugger with a gun or maniac with an axe type of murder?”</p>\n\n<p>Also, you might challenge rule with consequences. “Do you think that a woman who had abortion should spend, all else being equal, the same number of years in prison as a murderer?” “Does it mean you expect there would be more positive and less negative consequences, if state passed the law equating abortion and murder?”</p>\n\n<p>Another way to deal with this kind of statement is to ask your IL to <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalist_taboo\" target=\"_blank\">reformulate</a> it without using certain words. “These words seem to bear a lot of luggage. Could you please tell me what you mean by that without using words “abortion” and “murder”, so I can better understand what exactly you consider bad?”</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Casual conversations provide an excellent opportunity to gain SE experience and to help people revise their beliefs and get closer to the truth. I have shared a few insights on how to approach the discussion of “what there is” and “how it should be”, calling them scientific and ethical tracks respectively. I hope this information will help you enhance your mastery of SE, yielding more meaningful dialogues every day.</p>",
      "using-street-epistemology-with-loved-ones": "<p>\n</p><h1>Using Street Epistemology with Loved Ones</h1>\n<p>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-534471447/ep-136-blog-post-using-street-epistemology-with-loved-ones-anthony-magnabosco\">Listen to the audio version</a>\n\n</p><p>\n</p><center>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/loved-ones.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\"><br>\n</center>\n\n<p>\nPeople who have become familiar with SE-related content contact me frequently over social media and ask if I have any advice before they use this method with a loved one: their spouse, kids, parents, co-worker, dear friend, etc. I usually pass along a few pointers, but always think to myself, \"I really need to write a detailed article about this so I can just send them a link.\" \n\n</p><p>\nWell, this is that blog post. \n\n</p><p>\nI’ve had a few SE-inspired talks with close family and friends, and I wish we had agreed in advance to record it. The discussions were just as profound, revealing, and emotional as the ones you can find on my YouTube channel.\n\n</p><p>\nTo date, every Street Epistemology-based conversation I have filmed and uploaded has been with strangers, usually someone that I have just met for the very first time. The talks are also what I call \"interview style.\" That is, they are less a back-and-forth conversation and are carried out more like an inquisitive researcher interviewing an energetic subject.\n\n</p><p>\nThrow in a clipboard, a timer, and perhaps a video recorder, and you get the idea.\n\n</p><p>\nPersonally, I absolutely <em>enjoy</em> conducting “street” Epistemology where the talks are initiated. I never know what belief a person will choose to discuss or which direction the talk will go. I also get to hone my skills, and it’s incredibly rewarding when your interlocutor later exclaims, “That was the best talk I’ve had with someone in a very long while!”\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Situational Awareness</h2>\n<p>\nWhile the approach of SE with family and friends is the same as strangers—focus on the \"how\" and less on the \"what\" and \"why\"—the dynamics are drastically different. Strangers (particularly if they are being recorded) will often be more wary of your objectives. After all, you probably just met and have only spent a few minutes getting to know each other, if that.\n\n</p><p>\nFor some, speaking with family members is advantageous; you’ve built rapport over countless hours, can easily read each others’ body language, and the chance of meeting again to resume the discussion at a later time is high.\n\n</p><p>\nPeople who are close to you will also have a much better idea of who you are: your history, what you believe, and perhaps even what you think of their beliefs. This can get further complicated if you attempted to discuss their beliefs in the past and things became heated. Even if your previous discussions didn't go well, I still think most people can recover from that by shifting gears and employing a little \"off-street\" epistemology.\n\n</p><p>\nSometimes, simply acknowledging your past difficulties and offering to revisit the subject from another approach could be all it takes to re-engage with your mom who thinks the Bible is true because it is without error. Giving it another try using SE could possibly begin to repair a relationship that may have been damaged by more confrontational approaches.\n\n</p><p>\nFor example, how would your loved one react if you said, “I realize things got a little difficult the last time we chatted about this, but if you’re okay with it, I’d like to have a more respectful dialogue. Essentially, ask questions to better understand your position. Would that be acceptable?\" If they demur, feel free to explain that you’d like to try using Street Epistemology. Don’t hesitate to tell them all they want to learn about the method; there is nothing to hide.\n\n</p><p>\nRemember that SE works best when you are being neutral. Of course, with family members and friends, they'll probably know your position on the topic at hand so it may be difficult to assure them that you will try your best to be open to their views. Acknowledge your biases (we all have them) and clarify your goals. For example, “While I don’t believe in any Gods, I really want to understand how you concluded that your belief is true. I’m willing to set aside my views as best I can in order to sincerely hear you out.”\n\n</p><p>\nA good way to demonstrate your commitment to being impartial is to share a time when you believed something, but later learned that you were mistaken. For example, explain how uneasy you felt when you were incorrect about something, and later, how great it felt when you no longer held that mistaken belief. By framing the discussion as a joint effort to discover truth, you may find that the resulting conversation brought everyone involved closer together.\n\n</p><p>\nAnother factor to consider is the venue where you plan to have your discussion. Would a coffee shop be better than a long-distance car ride? What kind of noisy distractions might disrupt your talk? Will other people be around to interject and possibly throw things off-track?\n\n</p><p>\nIn my experience, a one-on-one talk in a quiet location without tight time constraints will yield the best results. This allows you both to set the pace, take breaks, and let the discussion unfold naturally. If possible, turn off the electronics and dedicate yourselves to a leisurely, uninterrupted conversation.\n\n</p><p>\nWhile a quiet place is ideal, you may not have this luxury and will just have to work with your environment. Perhaps Mom’s phone rings just as you were about to ask your most thought-provoking question, or Sister’s baby wakes up and is ready for his feeding. Your friend’s car alarm starts to go off. When/if these things happen, jot down where you left off and try to resume the dialogue or schedule another time to meet again. \n\n</p><p>\nKeep in mind that Street Epistemology works best when people take time to think about the talk on their own, so don’t get discouraged if you have to wrap things up unexpectedly.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Raised Stakes</h2>\n<p>\nA botched conversation with a stranger, while awkward, can be easily forgotten. It can be merely a blip on the radar, or an experience that helps you improve for the next talk, becoming something you can laugh about later.\n\n</p><p>\nHowever, when it comes to the people you know, love, and/or care about, the stakes are much, much higher. Your marriage, your relationship with kids, your job—everything that you have surrounded yourself with over the years could be at risk by deciding to have a talk about your loved one's deeply-held belief, be it about a God, law of attraction, karma, conspiracy theories, politics, etc.\n\n</p><p>\nSo first, before proceeding, you need to be honest with yourself about your objectives: What am I hoping to accomplish here? Why do I care what they believe? What’s the worst-case scenario? What is my definition of a successful talk? Is the potential fallout worth the effort? Can I be true to myself if we don’t conduct this much-needed conversation? Is their belief a deal-breaker in our relationship? Can I learn to accept their belief and move on?\n\n</p><p>\nThese are just a few of the many questions one must honestly ponder before deciding to engage a loved one on their cherished belief using Street Epistemology.\n\n</p><p>\nAnd remember that this conversation is not just about you. The discussion includes a person you likely care very deeply about. While identifying your personal goals beforehand is wise, continue to cater the discussion to the needs of your interlocutor. This is an effort to understand their methodology and discover together if it is as sturdy as they have come to believe.\n\n</p><p>\nAnother option to consider before talking with the important people in your life is to practice beforehand. There are a <em>ton</em> of Street Epistemology training resources available today.\n\n</p><p>\nFamiliarize yourself with the growing number of video examples of SE on YouTube. Read the Street Epistemology Guide. Install the <em>Atheos</em> app on your mobile device. Having co-facilitated more than 10 group sessions over video chat, I have found that role-play is a great way to prepare yourself for a discussion with a loved one. I suspect you could easily find somebody in the Private Street Epistemology Facebook Group who is willing to conduct a mock SE session while you pretend to be your spouse, or vice-versa.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Too Hot to Handle</h2>\n<p>\nSometimes the belief in question is just too sensitive to bring up, even after cautiously considering all of the suggestions listed above. This is completely understandable, so don’t be too hard on yourself if you are in this predicament. It’s very common.\n\n</p><p>\nI’ve been told of situations where the mere idea of suggesting a conversation about a loved one’s God belief resulted in tears and nights on the couch. Beliefs in a deity are particularly tricky because they are so closely tied to one’s own self-identity. Questioning your husband’s belief in Jesus can be perceived as a direct attack on who he is as a person. This is not limited to him; others who share his belief may see your inquiry as a direct threat to who they are as people. \n\n</p><p>\nWhen the circumstances are this delicate, I suggest setting aside the sensitive topics for the time being and have a Socratic discussion about safer claims: Why do you think red cars get more speeding tickets than other ones? What made you think this pizza place has faster service than their other location? How did you conclude this lucky rabbit’s foot would help sell our car? Could bringing sand home from Hawaii really put a curse on our family?\n\n</p><p>\nStarting with benign, everyday beliefs will not only help your loved one begin to become accustomed to examining the beliefs they hold, but you will also become more proficient with your questions. Your best friend is far less likely to close down in a conversation about why she believes paper bags are better for the environment than plastic ones, because her identity is probably not tied to the belief. These exchanges will likely help her become more comfortable with your method of inquiry, particularly if you have several discussions on a variety of safer topics.\n\n</p><p>\nIf selecting beliefs to examine that your interlocutor holds cuts too close to the bone, still try to have a discussion together, but make it about someone else: What are your thoughts about the new signage they put up at the store? Do you think Jim’s claim that he can cut his lawn faster with his new lawn mower is true? Why do you think our new neighbors decided to become Wiccans? \n\n</p><p>\nAfter a few talks like this, encourage your interlocutor to “turn the tables” and respectfully challenge <em>you</em> on a belief. You could even agree to pick a belief that you once had, and role-play what that conversation might have looked like. Model the openness and curiosity you would like to see in your friend, and ask her afterwards what she thought about the exchange.\nOver time, your loved ones may begin to start performing “self-interventions” when they are alone with their thoughts, and may become more open to the idea of examining their sensitive core beliefs. \n\n</p><p>\nResist the temptation to fast-track this process. It could take <em>years</em> to encourage your spouse or friend—particularly if they have been discouraged to question things in the past—to value and use Socratic inquiry. Always be on the lookout for opportunities in your everyday activities to re-introduce critical thinking and introspective inquiry.\n\n</p><p>\nIt’s also important to reward your partner’s skepticism when you notice it. But don’t go overboard; you don’t want to come across as condescending. Try to find that perfect response that acknowledges when they expressed doubt on a claim, but don’t make too big a deal out of it. Something simple might be all you need. For example: “Hmm. That’s a great question, honey. I also wonder how they determined that this toothpaste reduced cavities by 30 percent!”\n\n</p><p>\nIf you have children, you can easily turn their inquisitiveness into a fun learning experience. Something as simple as, “Hey kids! I just saw a flying saucer land in the park across the street!” could lead to an hour of fun dialogue where you encourage them to question your claim.\n\n</p><p>\n</p><h2>Leverage Community</h2>\n<p>\nFinally, take advantage of the growing secular community that is getting behind Street Epistemology. Support groups like Recovering from Religion (RFR) have offered SE resources to people looking for ways to have more productive talks with believers. RFR has a wonderful phone and chat service where you can talk with a trained volunteer who will listen and be a sounding board for your concerns.\n\n</p><p>\nMany atheists familiar with SE are married to believers, they work with believers, and have friends and family who are believers. In an effort to bring people who have more experience with these sensitive situations together with folks who are just starting to get into it, a “secret” Facebook Group has been created. This group is a wonderful community for non-believers looking to have more effective talks with the loved ones in their lives, and I urge you to consider joining by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:emergingfaithhelp@gmail.com\">emailing</a> to start the application process.\n\n</p><p>\nPlease contact me directly if you found this article lacking in any way. Going forward, this post is where I will direct people who contact me when they are are looking for ways to talk to their loved one about their deeply-held beliefs. I am completely open to adding comments below as an addendum every so often as new suggestions come up. Helping me to identify any gaps here will likely benefit many people who read this post in the years to come.\n\n</p><p>\n<br>\n<i>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anthonymagnabosco.com\">Anthony Magnabosco</a> is an agnostic atheist and a regular practitioner of Street Epistemology.\n</i>\n\n\t\t</p>",

The non-confrontational, methodical, friendly approach, I thought, would allow me to have interesting and effective conversations with anyone, about anything. I was correct.</p>\n\n<p>First using the method online in text chats, and later organically in conversations (and with a few Jehovah's Witnesses!), I began desiring “real” SE interviews. Partially inspired by the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/So4O34LyF_U\" target=\"_blank\">Free Intelligent Conversation</a> movement, I decided to set up regularly at my local coffee shop. As of this writing, I’ve done more than 20 interviews on topics such as God, Karma, nurture vs. nature, the existence of alien life, prayer, immigration, male circumcision and more.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this blog post is to teach the reader how to do SE successfully in a coffee shop. For many people, coffee shops are close-by and accessible year-round. Below, I’ve outlined what I’ve learned, which I hope will inspire many others to do coffee shop SE.</p>\n\n<p>My preferred location is a coffee shop, in this case a Starbucks, but a casual restaurant (in the United States think Panera Bread) also works well. Both of these establishments are amenable to people camping out for hours on end while working. It is good form to also be a paying patron.</p>\n\n<h2>The Essentials</h2>\n\n<p>The bare minimum for SE is: a sign, a notepad, a pen, and a friendly disposition.</p>\n\n<p>Following is a complete list of what I bring. Keep in mind, I’m camping at these locations primarily to work, doing SE only as a hobby to break up the day. I bring a backpack, laptop, phone charger, light jacket (these places often crank up the A/C), <a href=\"https://streetepistemology.com/publications/addressing_it_s_true_for_me_relativism_in_street_epistemology\" target=\"_blank\">Tic Tacs</a>, gum, and business cards.</p>\n\n<p>I try to wear a colorful shirt to stand out and in general look professional and approachable. Not to be captain obvious, but don’t wear a ball cap with a hoodie tightly drawn around your face and sunglasses. Also, don’t try too hard; people will think you are trying to sell them something.</p>\n\n<h2>The Method</h2>\n\n<p>I scout out a 2-person table where my sign will be visible to people entering and leaving. The high-top tables at Starbucks don’t work well, as people often sit across from you and wouldn’t give a prospective conversation partner a place to sit. Also, I don’t hog the large round tables.</p>\n\n<p>I keep my radar on. If I spot someone reading my sign, I’ll smile, wave, and point to the sign. They will usually come over out of curiosity. Even a 30 second exchange when the person doesn’t have time for an SE interview might brighten someone’s day. “That’s really cool what you are doing”, “Maybe next time”, or “We could use more intelligent conversation” are just some of the comments I frequently get from would-be interlocutors.</p>\n\n<p>Bringing the backpack helps me keep a clean, clutter free table. My table has the sign and my laptop, that’s all. I’ll pull my notepad out when someone sits down and close the laptop. Closing the laptop signals to your IL you aren’t half-working or distracted and are now focused entirely on the interview.</p>\n\n<h2>Details &amp; FAQs</h2>\n\n<p><strong>A printed <a href=\"https://freeic.org/shop/sign\" target=\"_blank\">sign</a> is a must</strong>. I first experimented with a hand-written sign. Last year, I happened to be in a city where I had to work at a coffee shop for a week nearly 6 hours per day. I got no interviews with the hand written sign. Zero. None. What are my results with the printed sign? I get a few interviews each time I go out!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you need permission?</strong> I have not asked staff permission, since I’m passively getting people to sit down with me, but if it puts your mind at ease, mention it to the staff first. Reassure them that you are not selling anything and are only passively putting out a sign and won’t bug people. So, don’t bug people; let them come to you. I’m now somewhat known by the staff at my regular location, and some of the staff have even done interviews.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the drawbacks?</strong> The major downside to coffee shop SE is it’s a terrible location to record video or audio. If this isn’t your goal, as it isn’t mine (you won’t find me on YouTube, sorry), it’s a moot point. Also, it can take a while to get an IL, if you get one at all. I work while waiting for a conversation partner, so think about productive things you can do in the down time, such as reading <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Manual-Creating-Atheists-Peter-Boghossian/dp/1939578094\" target=\"_blank\">AMFCA</a>. In short, this isn’t the steady stream of interlocutors you see Anthony Magnabosco or others getting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I initiate interviews?</strong> Here’s my lead in: “Hi, I’m Adam. I work from home, but like to work here a day a week to break up the routine. I came up with this hobby to have intelligent conversations and exercise critical thinking. What I do is interview people for 5 minutes, or more if you want, on a belief they hold to be true. What we do together is examine your reasons you believe it is true and how you determined it actually is true. It’s fun!”</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>I believe doing Street Epistemology in a coffee shop is a great idea for those interested in trying the method, but who don’t desire or have time to produce content. Coffee shop SE offers a low barrier to entry insofar as it only requires a sign. You don’t need a table, microphones, GoPros, editing software, etc. If you are one of the many people already spending significant amounts of times in coffee shops and casual restaurants, why not mix in a little SE with your Venti? You’ll be glad you did.</p>\n\n<p><br>\n&nbsp;</p>",
      "when-to-abstain-from-street-epistemology": "<center><img src=\"/assets/images/runaway.jpg\"></center>\n\n<p>\n</p><h1><center>When to Abstain from Street Epistemology</center></h1>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-534471447/ep-069-blog-post-when-to-abstain-from-street-epistemology-street-epistemology\">Listen to the audio version</a>\n\n</p><p>\nOne question inevitably comes up when I give talks on Street Epistemology: is there ever a time when you should <em>avoid</em> having a conversation with someone that could cause them to doubt a belief? My answer has evolved a bit over hundreds of talks with believers. Today, if I think the person I am speaking with seems unusually dependent on a belief, I'll simply ask them if they want to believe true things.\n\n</p><p>\nIf a person confirms that they want to hold true beliefs and discard false beliefs, I will usually continue with the discussion. Of course, the concept of \"truth\" can wildly vary from person to person, but that's a topic for another blog post. That said, if someone seems unsure as to whether they value truth, stay on the topic of truth until the reasons for their hesitation have been fully explored.\n\n</p><p>\nSome think older people should just be left alone when it comes to their beliefs. That reeks of ageism and disrespect to me.  Would I have a conversation with a 77-year-old who believes in Christ because it was drilled into him as a kid? <a href=\"https://youtu.be/at8eRsORiRM\">Absolutely</a>. How about an elderly woman who believes her dead husband was communicating with her when a butterfly landed on her shoulder? <a href=\"https://youtu.be/M1X2AuYJ8Xc\">Sure</a>. What if a middle-aged woman who believes she has the uncanny ability to tell when people will die or not? <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zx0MUjaEOLs\">Definitely</a>.\n\n</p><p>\nThe decision to start or continue a talk with a willing participant is ultimately your choice. There are no hard and fast rules here, with one exception: first, do no harm. For example, I once ended a talk with a person who believed a Pagan goddess protected her because there was something about her demeanor that suggested she was unusually dependent on this belief. My decision quickly proved to be mistaken: the same woman emailed me 30 minutes later, expressed gratitude for the talk, and asked to keep the discussion going, which <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh10RgQgGuM_U37md4h9f2jglPZLt0oU1\">we did</a>.\n\n</p><p>\nOther times the decision to end a talk is clear: the person is mentally impaired by substance abuse, they have a serious illness and expect to die soon, they start to get upset and begin to threaten you, they stand by their proclamations of harming themselves or others if they no longer held the belief, or they are so closed off and defensive that it is nearly impossible to make any headway.\n\n</p><p>\nYou should also probably avoid engaging in Street Epistemology on sensitive beliefs in situations where there is a power dynamic. For example, doctor and patient, professor and student, employer and employee, house owner and housekeeper, vendor and client. While a person <em>could</em> leverage their authority, I am personally uncomfortable using SE in situations where there is even the slightest <em>perception</em> I might be taking advantage of a social dynamic that confers authority. Street Epistemology works best when people on equal footing collaborate to explore a deeply-held belief.\n\n</p><p>\nWhat about using Street Epistemology with kids? For example, say you are babysitting your 7-year-old niece and she asks you about Noah's Ark. Instead of directly examining her claim, I might engage her with a related but fun scenario where she could practice her critical thinking skills, for example \"I wonder if all the stuffed animals you own would fit on top of this table. What do you think?\" Saving your epistemological conversations for later with her parents may yield long-term results for the entire family. I also suggest teaching your own kids how to use SE so they can do the work for you. Imagine sitting in your recliner while listening to your child engage their friend in some good-natured SE about monsters!\n\n</p><p>\nAnother time to bail out of a conversation is when someone insists that you participate in one. A woman once insisted I interview her after concluding a talk with her friend, adding that her post-suicidal self-worth would be affected if I declined. It took several attempts to politely excuse myself before she finally conceded. Just as you should never force anyone to have a chat with you, don't let anyone manipulate you into speaking with them. The take-away here: only engage in SE if both parties have consented to participate in the conversation.\n\n</p><p>\nA middle-aged man once told me that he would go on a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CVzV-b_8jGs\">shooting spree</a> if he no longer believed his good deeds were being tracked in some kind of metaphysical database. If I were new to Street Epistemology, I probably would have ended the talk and moved on. However, based on his earlier empathetic statements, he did not seem to be a real threat. We pushed past what was likely a defensive mechanism to protect his cherished belief, and afterwards I was delighted that we did. Use your best judgment here: if someone does make a credible threat of violence, end the talk and seek safety. Fortunately, most people are willing to honestly evaluate their beliefs. Even people who initially state that they would harm others if they no longer held a belief might only be saying so because they’ve heard others in their group say it.\n\n</p><p>\nExercise your judgement on when to begin a talk, when to end a talk, and when to resume a talk. What might constitute a boundary for you might be acceptable for someone else. In doing so, consider the interlocutor's commitment to truth, their physical and emotional states, their willingness to partake in the conversation with you, and your availability to be there afterwards to provide any needed support.\n\n</p><p>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/magnabosco\">Anthony Magnabosco</a> is an agnostic atheist and frequent practitioner of Street Epistemology.\n\n</p><p>\n\n\t\t</p>"

Loftus&rsquo; &ldquo;Outsider Test for       Faith.&rdquo;     </p>      <p>       Here is a list of commonly-used acronyms:       <br />       <a href=\"https://streetepistemology.com/publications/list_of_common_acronyms_used_in_street_epistemology\">         https://streetepistemology.com/publications/list_of_common_acronyms_used_in_street_epistemology       </a>     </p>      <hr />     <h2>What is the purpose of SE?</h2>      <p>       The general goal of Street Epistemology is to help people to reflect on the reasons and methods that they use       to conclude that their deeply-held beliefs are true.&nbsp;     </p>      <p>       Encouraging someone to reflect on a belief via SE can introduce doubt and is sometimes called &quot;planting a       seed&quot; or &quot;placing a pebble in the shoe&quot; - a positive SE outcome that can lead to the individual       either finding better and more solid reasons for believing what they believe or discarding a belief after       realizing that it has poor foundations. Verbal or nonverbal indications of reflective thinking and hearing the       phrase &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; are good signs. Side benefits of having the conversation can include the       opportunity to model openness and to teach the SE technique.     </p>      <p>       However, it is important to recognize that not all practitioners and conversations are the same, that       different practitioners may have different understandings of what the ultimate aim of street epistemology       should be, and that a practitioner&#39;s goals may shift as a conversation progresses.&nbsp;     </p>      <p>       For additional information, click here:       <br />       <a href=\"https://streetepistemology.com/publications/street_epistemology_the_basics\">         https://streetepistemology.com/publications/street_epistemology_the_basics       </a>     </p>      <hr />     <h2>Do SE conversations require flagging down strangers for interviews on camera?</h2>      <p>       No, not at all. People can get this impression because the &ldquo;strangers on camera&rdquo; interviews are       published and shared (and unrecorded conversations are not), but it&rsquo;s misleading. SE is a tool which can       be used in any conversation in just about any context.     </p>      <hr />     <h2>Is Street Epistemology atheist evangelizing and/or proselytizing?</h2>      <p>       At first glance, it can certainly seem like that is the case. The words &ldquo;street&rdquo; can give the       impression that this is akin to &ldquo;street preaching,&rdquo; and many of most visible examples of SE are       filmed on the street with people in public and often examine God claims.     </p>      <p>       However, when someone is proselytizing, they are usually confident that they have the answers and want to tell       you what you should believe. In contrast, a street epistemologist will ask questions about what you believe in       an effort to understand and examine the epistemology of your belief.&nbsp;     </p>      <p>       A sincere SE-er aims to encourage their conversation partner to explore what they believe, why they believe       it, and how they determined that their belief is true. Further, the SE-er should always try to remind       themselves to be open to their interlocutor&rsquo;s claim and should be willing to increase their confidence       in that claim if it appears that the belief is indeed based on a reliable method.     </p>      <hr />     <h2>My friend believes something that is likely untrue. How can I get them to change their mind?</h2>      <p>       It&rsquo;s great that you want to help your friend hold beliefs that align with reality. And yet it is       important to try and view SE as a tool to explore a person&rsquo;s foundation for their belief--if they are       willing and provide consent! If they are not ready to have this conversation, don&rsquo;t try to force it.     </p>      <p>       Be prepared for the possibility that your friend based their belief on good reasons and a solid method. And if       they didn&rsquo;t, try to make the discovery an exciting project that you can both embark on together.     </p>      <p>       Ultimately, however, your conversation partner will be the one who may decide to lower (or raise) their       confidence in their belief, or perhaps even discard it outright. Your questions may be instrumental in       facilitating honest reflection, but remind yourself that people tend to change their minds when they are ready       to do so; oftentimes, at some cost.     </p>      <p>       These conversations and what they lead to may be painful, and they may trigger hostility in defense of the       belief. If you practice SE with the people who are close to you, bear in mind that it may affect your       relationship with them.     </p>      <hr />     <h2>I disagree with what my interlocutor has claimed. Should I tell them?</h2>      <p>This is an excellent and frequently-asked question in SE circles.</p>      <p>       It is up to the practitioner to decide how much to reveal about your position on the claim being discussed and       when. Some may wish to wait until after the belief has been investigated to avoid causing a person to become       defensive or uneasy. Others feel it is important to disclose one&rsquo;s position beforehand out a matter of       respect and/or to model honesty, even if doing so could make a discussion a bit tougher to navigate.&nbsp;     </p>      <p>       Some SE-ers may offer to disclose their position after the claimant&rsquo;s views have been explored so as not       to sway them one way or the other. If you offer to do this, make sure you follow through and reveal your       views--it might even make for a good opportunity for them to question you using the same approach!     </p>      <p>       Regardless of your decision, it is best to set aside your biases and views on the claim as much as possible       since it is your interlocutor&rsquo;s position that we want to examine.     </p>      <hr />     <h2>Do I have to study formal, academic epistemology to do SE?</h2>      <p>       Formal study is unnecessary since SE is not the application or study of epistemology, but rather a       conversational technique developed to assist laypersons in having productive conversations about       epistemology.&nbsp;     </p>      <p>       That being said, it&#39;s very helpful to understand what epistemology is as well as the philosophical       definitions of and distinctions between knowledge, belief, and confidence. In addition, formal study of       epistemology in an academic setting may enable you to go beyond the basics of SE to dialogue with those who       are themselves studied in epistemology or to develop your own techniques for effective dialogue on the topic.       So it can be beneficial to practicing SE, but it is not a prerequirement.     </p>      <hr />     <h2>Are there reasons to prefer SE methods over other methods of engagement?</h2>      <p>For example:</p>      <ul>       <li>Directly presenting evidence which counters their belief</li>       <li>Ridiculing their beliefs</li>       <li>Showing them the counter-apologetics and refutations of their claims</li>     </ul>      <p>       SE was originally created to avoid common psychological biases which impede cordial discussions and       self-examination when people feel that their deeply-held beliefs are being attacked. Whether SE is the       &ldquo;best&rdquo; way to approach a given conversation will largely depend on your implicit and explicit       goals, as well as the context of the conversation. It is recommended to ask yourself introspective questions       such as:     </p>      <ul>       <li>         What outcomes have I obtained from each approach in past conversations, and are those the outcomes I desire         here?       </li>       <li>         Has my IL already made up their mind on this topic, and are they receptive to evidence which disconfirms         their stance?       </li>       <li>         Is it important that they enjoy the conversation, and leave the door open to future discussions on this         topic?       </li>       <li>         Am I currently in a professional setting, at a family gathering, on a radio call-in show, or have other         special circumstances? Does the setting affect the approach I should use?       </li>     </ul>      <p>       More information:       <br />       <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds\">         https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds       </a>     </p>      <hr />     <h2>Are there times where it could be harmful to practice SE?</h2>      <p>       Depending on your goals, the answer is almost certainly yes. It is broadly accepted that there are contexts in       which SE has potential to do more harm than good.     </p>      <p>       More information:       <br />       <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtmtIBIBfNI\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtmtIBIBfNI</a>     </p>      <hr />     <h2>I&rsquo;d like to learn how to use SE.
